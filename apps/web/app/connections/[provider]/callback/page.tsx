/**
 * Where the vendor sends the browser back to — `doc/14` S9.
 *
 * **The redirect URI registered with the provider must be this page**, not the
 * API's callback. Both would work in the sense that the exchange completes; only
 * one of them lands a person on a page instead of on a JSON document. The API
 * route is still what verifies `state` and exchanges the code — this page hands
 * it the query string and renders what comes back.
 *
 * Outside the app shell on purpose. Somebody arriving here has just come from a
 * third party and is mid-flow; a full navigation with a header inviting them
 * elsewhere is how a connection gets abandoned one step from done.
