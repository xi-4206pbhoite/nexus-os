/**
 * The screen the rest of the product kept pointing at.
 *
 * Finding F3. `/register-company` said twice that proving the domain happens
 * "in Settings", and `POST /invitations` refused with *"Settings has the DNS
 * record to add"* — while no `/settings` route existed, the verification card
 * was written and imported by nothing, and no screen anywhere sent an
 * invitation. Because the domain gate is genuinely enforced server-side, the
 * missing page was not cosmetic: invite, accept and per-member scoping could
 * not be exercised through a browser at all.
 *
 * Client-fetched for the same reason as `/account` and `/onboarding`: a server
 * component would have to render either the signed-in or the signed-out view
 * before the client knew which, and a mismatch shows as a flash of the wrong
 * screen.
