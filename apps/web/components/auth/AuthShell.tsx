/**
 * The frame around every auth page.
 *
 * Two columns on desktop: the form on the left, the paper-cut landscape on the
 * right. The landscape is the landing page's own artwork rather than a stock
 * illustration, so signing in does not feel like leaving the product — but it is
 * `aria-hidden` and drops away entirely below `lg`, where a form has better uses
 * for the space.
 *
 * ## The artwork reaches the edge of the glass
 *
 * It did not. The grid was `max-w-6xl mx-auto`, so at 1440 the whole two-column
 * layout was 1152px wide and centred — which left a 144px strip of bone
 * page-background to the right of a full-bleed navy artwork panel. A dark panel
 * that stops 144px short of the window reads as a layout that failed to finish
 * loading, and it was the first thing anybody saw on the sign-in page.
 *
 * The grid is now full width. The *form* is what stays measured: its column
 * centres a `max-w-md` block, so the reading column is unchanged and only the
 * artwork gained the space it should always have had.

            and the SVG letterboxed well short of the bottom. Giving the column
            the full half of a 1440px window made the artwork taller than its
            own scrim, and the promise — the one line on this page that states
            what the product is for — printed across a boat.

            The artwork now takes the space that is left after the caption has
            had what it needs, so the two cannot collide at any height. */}
