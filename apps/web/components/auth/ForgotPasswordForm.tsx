/**
 * Asks for a reset link.
 *
 * **There is no error state, and that is the design.** The API answers
 * identically whether or not the address has an account, so this form has
 * nothing to distinguish — and a "no account with that address" message here
 * would be a complete account-enumeration oracle regardless of how carefully
 * the API avoided one. The confirmation below is deliberately written to be
 * true either way.
 *
 * A transport failure is swallowed for the same reason: "could not reach the
 * service" and "sent" must not depend on which address was typed. It cannot,
 * here — the request has already left — but keeping the two outcomes visually
 * identical removes the temptation to add a branch later.
