 * task.

 * This exists only so the ordinary typo is answered with the sentence beside
 * the button, rather than with a 422 whose message reached the screen verbatim
 * as pydantic wrote it — "Input should be a valid URL, relative URL without a
 * base", which tells a founder nothing about what to type.
 *
 * A false accept here costs nothing: the server still refuses it. A false
 * reject would block a legitimate address the server would have taken, so
