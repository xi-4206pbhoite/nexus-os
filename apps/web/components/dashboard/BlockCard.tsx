/**
 * One capability on the rail, in whatever state it is actually in.
 *
 * `doc/13` §7. Eight states, and **each one has to tell the reader something
 * different to do** — two states that produce the same action should be one
 * state, and a state whose action is wrong is worse than no tile at all.
 *
 * ## What the 2026-09 audit changed, and what it deliberately did not
 *
 * Nothing here was deleted. Every sentence the tile used to carry — what the
 * figure measures, what it excluded, the date it was read, whether anybody has
 * vouched that the record is complete, the capability's specification id — is
 * still rendered, still in the product's own words, still sourced from the API
 * rather than restated in the browser. What changed is **the order**, and the
 * reason is a measurement rather than a preference.
 *
 * On the dashboard as audited, a block card was about seventeen lines tall. One
 * of those lines was the number. The other sixteen were the apparatus that
 * makes the number trustworthy: a bolded lead-in and three lines of
 * methodology, a provenance line, and — on six of the twelve tiles at once — a
 * clay-coloured sentence reading *"You have not said whether this is all of
 * them, so this counts the record rather than the company."* That sentence is
 * correct and it is important. Repeated six times down one page in a warning
 * colour it is wallpaper, and wallpaper is the one thing a warning must never
 * become.
 *
 * So the face of the tile is now: its name, the figure, and the single clause
 * that qualifies the figure. Everything else moved behind one disclosure, in
 * the same place, with the same label, on every tile in the product — which
 * means "where did this come from?" has one answer a reader learns once, rather
 * than sixteen lines they have to read every time to find the one that matters.
 *
 * The product's promise is that every number is traceable. It was never that
 * every number arrives buried in its trace.
 *
 * ## Three specific reversals
 *
 * - **The `LIVE` badge is gone from the normal case.** Twelve tiles each wore
 *   one, in the highest-contrast treatment on a card whose point is a figure. A
 *   badge on everything marks nothing. `StateDot` renders 6px of colour and
 *   renders *nothing at all* when the state is `live`, so the tiles wearing a
 *   marker are exactly the ones that need reading.
 * - **The specification ids moved into the working.** `2.3`,
 *   `executive.todays_priorities` and a `CARDS` pill sat on the face of every
 *   tile. They exist so a tile on a screen can be traced to the paragraph that
 *   specified it, which is a real need — of somebody debugging the product, not
 *   of somebody running a business. They are one click away, beside the
 *   arithmetic, where that person is already looking.
 * - **The always-on completeness caveat became a badge plus a sentence.** The
 *   sentence is unchanged and lives in the working. On the face, an
 *   `Unconfirmed` badge says the same thing in two words without spending a
 *   warning colour on the ordinary state of a new workspace.
 *
 * ## The three rules that are easiest to lose
 *
 * - **`warming` never asks for a connection.** Telling somebody to connect what
 *   they already connected is how a product loses trust in its own
 *   instructions. It gets a date, not an instruction.
 * - **`self_reported` is never a metric.** `doc/05` §0 requires that a number
 *   they typed and a number we measured never look identical, so this renders
 *   as a tally of a record with its own provenance line rather than as a
 *   measurement.
 * - **`planned` carries no call to action.** An unbuilt widget cannot be
 *   unlocked by connecting anything, and offering an unlock would be a promise
 *   the product then breaks.
 */

/**
 * How each state should read at a glance.
