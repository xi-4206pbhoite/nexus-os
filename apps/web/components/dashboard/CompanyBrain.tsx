/**
 * What NEXUS is working from — `doc/14` step 7.
 *
 * The founder's own words, read back. **This panel carries no number**, and the
 * absence is the point: doc 05 §0 requires that something somebody typed and
 * something we measured never look alike, so the one region built entirely out
 * of stated facts is also the one with no figure in it.
 *
 * ## Fetched separately, and quietly
 *
 * `GET /brain` already exists and Settings already reads it. Folding it into
 * `/dashboards/surface` would put a second query on the critical path of the
 * page's first paint for content that sits well below the fold. So this loads on
 * its own and **renders nothing at all while it does** — no skeleton, because a
 * placeholder in the shape of a brain is indistinguishable from a brain that
 * came back empty.
 *
 * A failure is a quiet line rather than silence, for the reason every other
 * region on this surface gives: *could not load* and *nothing here yet* are
 * different facts, and swallowing the first makes it wear the second's clothes.
 * It is deliberately not an error box — the surface above has already loaded
 * and is useful, and a failure to draw a secondary panel must not cover it.
 *
 * ## The assumptions block is the part that matters
 *
 * A brain a founder cannot audit is a brain they have to take on trust, and this
 * product's whole claim is that they never have to. What NEXUS *assumed* is
 * therefore not a footnote — it is the one part of this panel somebody is
 * expected to act on.
