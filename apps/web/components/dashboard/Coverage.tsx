/**
 * Where the product is, for this company — ADR 0030.
 *
 * This replaces the "Company Health 82/100" the reference mock opened with. A
 * composite over two measured capabilities out of eighty-nine would read as a
 * verdict on the business and is a verdict on one web page, so the region says
 * something narrower and true instead: **who has to move next.**
 *
 * ## Why a bar is honest here and would not have been over sources
 *
 * The three bands partition what a caller can reach, so every capability is in
 * exactly one. Banding by *connected source* would not partition anything —
 * `marketing.seo_gaps` computes today and is still missing `dataforseo`, so it
 * belongs in two bands at once and a stacked bar would assert it belongs in one.
 *
 * ## The third band is the honest headline
 *
 * "Not built yet" is ours, and naming it is what makes the other two mean
 * anything: without it, a founder reads two-of-eighty-nine as a product waiting
 * on them. `planned` tiles already say this one at a time; this says it once, at
 * the top.
