/**
 * One director's page, inside the global shell doc 05 §1 specifies.
 *
 * The shell is deliberately partial and says which parts are missing. Doc 05 §1
 * lists a score, a data ribbon, an action queue, a period selector and an
 * "Ask this Director" chat; none of those have anything behind them yet, and
 * rendering an empty period selector or a score of `0` would break I10 on the
 * very page built to demonstrate it. What is here is the header, the director
 * switcher, and the offering list with each tile's real state.
 *
 * The switcher shows only the directors this caller may open — the API returns
 * no others, so a department the caller cannot reach is not merely hidden from
 * the nav, it is absent from the response.
