/**
 * One director's page, inside the global shell doc 05 §1 specifies.
 *
 * The shell is deliberately partial and says which parts are missing. Doc 05 §1
 * lists a score, a data ribbon, an action queue, a period selector and an
 * "Ask this Director" chat; none of those have anything behind them yet, and
 * rendering an empty period selector or a score of `0` would break I10 on the
 * very page built to demonstrate it. What is here is the header, the director
 * switcher, and the offering list with each tile's real state.
 *
 * **The department tab rail is gone** (`doc/14` step 1). It sat here and gated
 * the surface, so a founder had to pick a department before the product would
 * say anything — and a founder does not think in departments, they think about
 * what needs them today. Navigating between directors is the shell's left
 * panel now, and it still lists only what the caller may open, because the API
 * returns no others.
 *
 * The chrome this file used to draw — logo, header links, entity switcher —
 * belongs to `AppShell`, and `all` arrives through its context rather than
 * from a second fetch of the same endpoint (finding #23).
 *
 * ## What the 2026-09 audit changed
 *
 * **Two full-width banners no longer stand between the reader and the page.**
 * A steel one ("5 questions about how this department works are still
 * unanswered") and a gold one ("4 of this department's capabilities are
 * measured… there is still no department score: a composite of the 4 we can
 * see would score that much and be read as the whole…") together took 280
 * vertical pixels, so the tab rail — the page's actual navigation — began below
 * the midpoint of a laptop fold. Both say something true and neither is what
 * the reader came for.
 *
 * They are now one line of context with the full reasoning behind a
 * disclosure. Not deleted: the composite argument in particular is the
 * product's own case for why it will not average four figures and call it a
 * department, and somebody who wants it should find it. It is simply no longer
 * the first thing on the page every single visit.
 *
 * **The wait has a shape**, and a failure has a retry — the same two changes
 * `DashboardLanding` documents, for the same reasons.
