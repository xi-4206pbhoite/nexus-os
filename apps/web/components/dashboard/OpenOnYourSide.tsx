/**
 * What is still open on the founder's side — `doc/14` step 5.
 *
 * This replaces the reference mock's *Risks / Opportunities* columns. Those
 * needed a risk engine nobody has built; every line here comes from the question
 * bank, which has carried a `why` and a declared consumer since it was written.
 *
 * ## Answering informs; it does not unlock
 *
 * The design first claimed seven capabilities were "unlockable by answering".
 * The registry says zero — every fact-consuming tile also needs a source — so
 * the copy makes the smaller, true claim, and the split does the rest of the
 * work: one tier moves a number already on this page, and the other is counted
 * because a founder cannot act on it yet.
 *
 * ## Why the second tier is a number rather than a list
 *
 * Twenty-eight rows of questions whose consumers are not built would bury the
 * one that matters, and would let a founder believe the product is waiting on
 * them when it is mostly waiting on us. ADR 0030 makes the same argument about
 * capabilities; this is it at question level.
