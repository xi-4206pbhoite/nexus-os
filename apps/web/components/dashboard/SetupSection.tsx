/**
 * The Setup and Watchlist tabs. `doc/13` §4 and §9.
 *
 * These are the only two tabs on a day-one dashboard with anything on them, and
 * that is the whole argument for building them before the first connector. With
 * no CRM and no accounting system the rest of the rail is honest and empty; this
 * is the founder's own answers, read back.
 *
 * ## Three things it does that a form never does
 *
 * **It names who reads each answer.** Q33's rule is that a question with no
 * consumer is a form field, not a question. Showing the consumer is that rule
 * turned outward: the founder can see what their answer is *for*, and can see
 * when the honest answer is "nothing yet".
 *
 * **It carries the date.** An answer from four months ago and one from
 * yesterday warrant different confidence, and nothing else on the page can tell
 * a reader which they are looking at.
 *
 * **It never styles an answer as a measurement.** `doc/05` §0: a number they
 * typed and a number we measured must never look identical, because the second
 * can contradict them and the first cannot. So an answer is quoted, with an
 * attribution — never set in a metric slot with a delta beside it. That is what
 * the `facts` block kind exists for, and this is the first thing to use it.
