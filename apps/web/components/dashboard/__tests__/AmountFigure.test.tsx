/**
 * The second figure kind on screen — ADR 0033.
 *
 * The arithmetic is `calculators/pipeline.py`'s and is asserted there. What only
 * the browser can get wrong is the rendering, and every case here is a way of
 * looking right while saying something false:
 *
 * - **A null total drawn as zero.** "OMR 0" says the pipeline is worth nothing;
 *   the truth is that nothing in it could be added up (I10).
 * - **A denominator borrowed from the scored layout.** `23 / 148000` would read
 *   as a fraction, and a pipeline is not a fraction of anything.
 * - **A total that does not say what it omitted**, which is a total presented as
 *   complete.
 * - **A working drawer with an invented checklist.** A sum of rows has no nine
 *   weighted observations behind it.
