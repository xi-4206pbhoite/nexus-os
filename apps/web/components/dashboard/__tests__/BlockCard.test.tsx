/**
 * Every state, and every block kind. `doc/13` §7 and §6.
 *
 * The rule the whole thing serves: **each state has to tell the reader
 * something different to do.** Two states that produce the same action should
 * be one state, and a state whose action is wrong is worse than no tile at all.
 * So these tests assert on the *copy*, because the copy is the behaviour.
 *
 * Driven with props rather than through the API on purpose. Nothing is
 * reachable yet, so every real block is `planned` — and a component whose other
 * seven states are unreachable in practice is a component nobody has checked.
