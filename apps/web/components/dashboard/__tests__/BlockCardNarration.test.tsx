/**
 * The sentence on a tile: where it sits, what asks for it, and what happens
 * when there is none.
 *
 * Separate from `BlockCard.test.tsx` because that file is deliberately driven
 * by props alone and these need `fetch`. The split is worth keeping: a state
 * matrix that suddenly needs a network double is a state matrix people stop
 * extending.
 *
 * **Position is asserted, not just presence.** `BlockCard`'s own docstring
 * argues the ordering — figure, then sentence, then "needs keyword data" —
 * because a gloss on the number belongs on the number's side of that line, and
 * below the consequence it reads as a footnote to a footnote. Nothing but a DOM
 * order assertion can catch that being lost in a refactor; every
 * `getByText` passes with the paragraphs in any order at all.
