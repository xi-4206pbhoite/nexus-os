/**
 * The fourth figure kind — ADR 0036, and the only ops figure that divides.
 *
 * The arithmetic is `calculators/dispatch.py`'s and the gates are
 * `compute_rate_from_ops`'s. What only the browser can get wrong is the
 * rendering, and a rate has more ways to mislead than any other kind here:
 *
 * - **A refusal drawn as 0%.** "0% on time" is a damning figure; the truth is
 *   that we may not divide at all (I10).
 * - **A percentage with no denominator**, which is a claim nobody can check.
 * - **A shared "unavailable" message.** The two gates are different problems —
 *   one takes ten seconds to fix and one does not — so a single sentence would
 *   send half the readers to do the wrong thing.
 * - **A rule left invisible.** A percentage judged by a threshold the reader
 *   cannot see is a percentage they cannot argue with.
