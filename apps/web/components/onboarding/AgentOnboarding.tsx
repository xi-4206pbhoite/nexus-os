/**
 * Guided onboarding: a conversation, a stack, and an arrival.
 *
 * **Three sections over eight phases.** The server still keeps all eight —
 * `Phase` has a CHECK constraint behind it and an ordering the assembly depends
 * on — but a person meeting the product for the first time was being handed a
 * seven-step rail and asked to hold it in their head. The four phases that are
 * all the same conversation are one step now; the two that are the assembly and
 * its result are one arrival. See `SECTIONS` for why this is a grouping and
 * must stay one.
 *
 * **The transcript belongs to the conversation and stops at its edge.** Tools
 * and Summary are screens of their own. The tools step used to render under the
 * entire interview, so the one place in onboarding asking somebody to make a
 * decision opened with several hundred words of their own history.
 *
 * **It is a chat and only a chat.** There used to be a second column beside it
 * — a Company Brain ledger and a Your Persona sheet — filling in fact by fact
 * as the interview ran. The intent was a receipt, and the effect was homework:
 * a person mid-sentence about their own job was also being asked to audit a
 * table being written in their peripheral vision, on the screen where they have
 * the least context in the whole product. What was recorded is still shown and
 * still correctable, but at the moments it means something — the brief, inline,
 * as one decision; and the persona, at the end, as one summary they confirm
 * before the workspace is built.
 *
 * **It opens by saying who it is talking to.** The greeting is drawn from what
 * the person typed at sign-up — name, job title, department — and needs no
 * model, so it is on screen before the crawl starts rather than after it ends.
 * That matters twice: it is the first evidence that this is their workspace and
 * not a demo, and it gives the twenty seconds of fetching and inference
 * something true to sit under instead of a progress sentence.
 *
 * **The brief is prose, not a form.** The agent says what it read and offers one
 * button. The editable fields exist — a Brain nobody corrected is one nobody has
 * reason to trust — but they are behind "Something is wrong", because a wall of
 * textareas is what a person is asked to face *before* they have been told
 * anything.
 *
 * **An answer can be spoken.** These are the longest free-text answers in the
 * product, and the microphone is the cheapest way to make them longer and
 * truer. Transcription is the browser's, so no audio reaches this product — see
 * `lib/dictation`. Where the API does not exist, the button does not render.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does **not** do:
 *
 * **It never sends the field an answer belongs to.** The composer posts text.
 * The server reads the target from the agent's own last turn. This component
 * displays the target because seeing where an answer lands is the point; it has
 * no say in choosing it.
 *
 * **It shows no percentage.** Progress is the named phase advancing. A
 * percentage needs a denominator, and the denominator here would be a guess at
 * how much there is to know about a company — the invented number the product
 * exists to refuse.
 *
 * **It does not degrade.** With no model configured the screen says so and stops
 * (ADR 0022). There is no form fallback, because a form that quietly replaces a
 * conversation is a different product wearing the same URL.

/**
 * Three sections, over the eight phases the server still keeps.
 *
 * **The phases did not change and deliberately must not.** `Phase` is a
 * `StrEnum` with `ck_onboarding_session_phase` behind it and
 * `test_constraint_enum_parity` comparing the two on every run; the ordering it
 * encodes — documents and tools *before* the assembly — is a precondition the
 * server checks, not a sequence the client is trusted to follow. What was wrong
 * was showing all eight, because a person meeting a product for the first time
 * was handed a seven-step rail and asked to hold it in their head.
 *
 * So this is a grouping, and only a grouping. The four phases that are all the
 * same conversation are drawn as one step; the two that are the assembly and
 * its result are drawn as one arrival. Nothing is skipped and nothing is
 * reordered — a session written by an older build resumes into exactly the
 * phase it left, and lands in whichever of these three contains it.
 *
 * `assembling` now has a home, which it never had before: it belongs to Summary
 * rather than to nothing, so the rail no longer goes blank for the twenty
 * seconds the Brain is being built. That was the old `phaseIndex === -1`.

 * The last screen of setup, and the first impression the product makes.
 *
 * ## It used to print the model's own briefing
 *
 * `state.context.preamble` was rendered here verbatim. `SKILL.md` for
 * `context-personalization` says what that field is: *"prose, under 400 words,
 * written to be prepended to a system prompt"* — so a founder finishing
 * onboarding read sentences addressed to an agent, including *"No pronoun is
 * known for UI Walk; use the name or 'they'"* and *"access is resolved
 * separately by the scope system per query"*.
 *
 * Showing somebody what the AI was told about them is a defensible feature and
 * fits this product. Showing them a system prompt is not the same thing. So
 * the preamble stays where it belongs and this renders `facts` — the same
 * content, structured, which the skill produces precisely so a caller does not
 * have to paste the prose.
 *
 * ## And it dropped the unlock it was holding
 *
 * The gap list showed `topic` only, joined with a middle dot, and then said
 * *"Each names its own unlock in your workspace"* — the product telling
 * somebody to go and look for what it already had in its hand. `unlocked_by`
 * travelled the whole pipeline and was never rendered. It is the action, so it
 * is the half worth showing.
 *
 * `readable_gaps` on the server normalises `topic` before it arrives: column
 * names become phrases, sentences lose the trailing stop that produced
 * *"exporting anything.."*, and a gap with no action is dropped rather than
 * listed as a dead end.

/**
 * The first screen, before there is any state to draw.
 *
 * It was one line of centred grey text on white, which for a wait this long
 * (a fetch and two model calls) is indistinguishable from a page that has
 * finished loading and has nothing on it. The aura says the process is alive;
 * the sentence says what it is doing and roughly how long — `useSlowLabel`
 * rewrites it once the wait runs past the usual.
 *
 * **The sentence stays.** `globals.css` collapses every animation to a single
 * iteration under `prefers-reduced-motion`, so the motion stops for anyone with
 * that set. A loader that is the *only* signal would go silent for exactly the
 * people least able to guess; motion is decoration here, never the message.
 *
 * `role="status"` rather than a bare div: the label changes mid-wait, and a
 * screen reader should hear that it changed without the focus moving.
 *
 * **It has to be able to stop.** A failure of the opening request leaves this
 * component with no state to render, so this is the screen it falls back to —
 * and a wait animation is exactly the wrong thing to show over a request that
 * has already failed. It said "Loading…" indefinitely, because `useSlowLabel`
 * returns its idle string once nothing is in flight. The error takes the place
 * of the pulse rather than appearing under it: two signals disagreeing about
 * whether anything is still happening is worse than either alone.
