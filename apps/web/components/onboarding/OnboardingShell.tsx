/**
 * The shell every stage of the combined onboarding flow renders inside.
 *
 * Direction A ("The Letter", `docs/design/design-directions-onboarding.md`)
 * deliberately has **no step rail** — a quiet "Part X of 3" eyebrow is the only
 * progress signal, because the brief that produced this design was "too
 * informative and tiring," and a rail is one more thing competing for
 * attention. `OnboardingAura`'s ambient wash keeps running underneath every
 * stage, per the recommendation's one borrowing from Direction C: it is a
 * real, already-shipped "something is happening" signal that costs nothing
 * once it exists, so there is no reason to drop it just because the page
 * around it changed shape.
 *
 * **The ground is white, not bone** (ADR 0071). `AmbientGradient` sits further
 * back than `OnboardingAura`'s wash — two soft, blurred tints from the
 * existing palette tokens, never more than half-opaque and blurred past any
 * edge — so the white canvas still reads as alive rather than inert, without
 * the wash's job of carrying `aura`'s state changing. Both layers are
 * `aria-hidden`, and `AmbientGradient`'s own motion is `motion-safe:`-gated on
 * top of the sitewide `prefers-reduced-motion` collapse in `globals.css`.
 *
 * Each stage is given a single `fadeUp` entrance — "each new screen simply
 * rises in place," never sideways — which is the calmest of the three
 * directions explored and the one explicitly recommended for a flow whose
 * entire brief was "make it feel shorter," not "make it feel more alive."
