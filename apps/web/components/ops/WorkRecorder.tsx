 * **Nothing is computed here.** The counts a founder reads live on the
 * Operations tiles, served by `grounding/compute.py` from `calculators/ops.py`.
 * This page lists rows. A "3 of 12 done" line added here would be a figure the
 * browser invented, which is I1's prohibition arriving from the friendliest
 * possible direction.
 *
 * **No permission rule is copied.** Whether this caller may write is
 * `routes/ops._may_write`'s decision and arrives as a 403 with a sentence
 * written for a person. Hiding the form on a guess would be a second copy of
 * the rule, and the copy that disagrees is the one on the screen.

 * border — is fixable in two lines rather than twenty-five call sites.
 *
 * `.control` and `.field-label` are the same classes the rest of the product's

 * does. Without an answer here, every ops rate — S10.4's on-time dispatch and

 *
 * Asked per entity, because somebody can plausibly have recorded every project
 * and a third of the tasks, and one switch covering both would let the honest
 * half vouch for the careless one.
 *
 * **Re-confirmable, and never a checkbox.** A checkbox reads as a setting that
