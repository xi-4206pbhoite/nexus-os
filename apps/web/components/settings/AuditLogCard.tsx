/**
 * The workspace's own trail — panel 12 (`doc/13` §14).
 *
 * **Refusals are recorded as well as successes**, which is the whole reason to
 * show it: a log that records only what worked cannot tell you that somebody
 * probed. The prototype says exactly this under its own audit table, and it is
 * the sentence a founder needs to read to understand what the log is for.
 *
 * Two things this panel does not do, deliberately:
 *
 * **It does not resolve the actor to a name.** The API returns a user id, and
 * turning that into an email means a join this endpoint does not do. A UUID is
 * useless to a human, so that is a real gap and it is named on screen rather
 * than papered over with "a user".
 *
 * **It does not offer a filter or a search box.** The API takes a limit with a
 * ceiling and no cursor — paging arrives when something needs it, and an offset
 * would be wrong anyway because rows are inserted while a reader pages. A
 * filter over the most recent fifty would look like a filter over the log.
