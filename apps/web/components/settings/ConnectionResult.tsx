/**
 * Completes the authorisation the vendor just sent the browser back from.
 *
 * **The query string is forwarded whole and never rebuilt.** `state` is signed
 * and bound to workspace, person and provider, and `code` is single-use — a
 * client that parsed and reassembled either would be a second place for that
 * check to go subtly wrong, and the failure would be an authorisation accepted
 * that should not have been.
 *
 * Runs once. A `code` is spent on first exchange, so a re-run on re-render would
 * ask the vendor to honour it twice and show the founder a failure for a
 * connection that actually succeeded.
