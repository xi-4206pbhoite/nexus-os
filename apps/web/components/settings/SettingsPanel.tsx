/**
 * Settings: the domain, and the people.
 *
 * Finding F3. `/register-company` said twice that proving the domain "happens
 * in Settings"; the invitation refusal said "Settings has the DNS record to
 * add"; and there was no `/settings` route, no import of the verification card
 * that had already been written, and no screen anywhere that sent an
 * invitation. The gate was real and correctly enforced server-side, which is
 * what made the missing screen expensive rather than cosmetic: the entire
 * multi-user half of the product was unreachable from a browser.
 *
 * Two fetches rather than one. The company answers what the domain is and
 * whether it is proved; the onboarding state answers which departments this
 * company runs, which is the list the invite form assigns from. Neither is
 * derivable from the other, and inventing a combined endpoint for one screen
 * would put a view's shape into the API.

  // **Only four things on this screen need the two fetches above**: the
  // company's identity line, the domain card, the invite form, and the
  // per-department blocks (which need the spine's department list). The other
  // six panels take no props and read their own endpoints.
  //
  // So gating the whole screen on `fetchCompany` made six independent requests
  // wait for a seventh they do not depend on — one serial round trip to
  // `us-east-2` in front of everything. Found in a browser: a full-page
  // "Loading your settings…", and then, once it cleared, six panels each
  // starting to load. The panels below now mount immediately and fetch in
  // parallel with the company, which is a latency fix and not only a
  // perceptual one.
  //
  // Some failures are still a takeover, because then *nothing* here can load
  // and one sentence with a link beats seven red boxes (finding F7).
  //
  // **The first version of this only took over on 401/403, and a browser
  // immediately showed why that was wrong.** With the API not running,
  // `fetchCompany` fails on transport rather than authorization — `code` is 0,
  // not 401 — so the screen rendered the scoped company error *and* six panels
  // that each then failed on the same dead origin: seven boxes saying the same
  // thing, where the old full-screen gate had said it once.
  //
  // The real question is not "is this person signed out" but **"can anything on
  // this screen load"**, and there are two ways the answer is no:
  //
  //   401 / 403 — not signed in, or not in a company yet. Every panel refuses.
  //   0         — the fetch itself never completed.
  //   503       — **the BFF's own "could not reach the API"**, not the API's.
  //               `auth-proxy.ts` returns it when the upstream call fails, and
  //               every panel on this screen proxies through that same BFF to
  //               that same API. This is the one the browser actually showed
  //               me: with the API stopped, the first fix (0/401/403) still
  //               rendered seven identical boxes, because the code was 503.
  //
  // Anything else is specific to `/companies/current` (a 404, a 500 on that one
  // endpoint) and *is* scoped, because the other six read different endpoints
  // and may genuinely be fine.
  //
  // The cost, stated because it is a real trade: one endpoint timing out under
  // load 503s alone and now takes the screen with it. That was also the old
  // behaviour — the whole screen was gated on this fetch — so it is not a
  // regression, and it is the better of the two failures.
  //
  // A second cost, measured in a browser: because the panels mount on the
  // first render, a signed-out visit fires eight requests and discards six of
  // them as 401s before this takeover replaces them. That is the price of the
  // parallelism, and it is worth paying — it buys a round trip on every
  // signed-in visit, which is the path that happens, in exchange for six cheap
  // refusals on a path that normally redirects before it gets here.

  /**
   * Six groups, not ten panels in a column.
   *
   * The audit's finding: `/settings` was a 4,709-pixel scroll of ten unrelated
   * concerns — the company, the domain check, invitations, one person's own
   * preferences, a block per department, reporting assumptions, the department
   * list, the brain, connected tools and the audit log — with no navigation of
   * any kind. Changing a timezone meant scrolling past the DNS record; checking
   * who had been invited meant knowing it was above reporting rather than below
   * it.
   *
   * The grouping is by **whose setting it is and what it reaches**, which is
   * the distinction this product already makes everywhere else:
   *
   * - *Company* is the entity and the two things that reach beyond your own
   *   account, which is why the domain check gates them.
   * - *You* is the one panel that can widen nothing for anybody.
   * - *Reporting* is the assumptions every figure is cut against, and the
   *   per-department thresholds belong with them because they are the same
   *   kind of thing: a number's meaning rather than a number.
   * - *Departments* decides which directors exist.
   * - *Data and tools* is what NEXUS reads from.
   * - *Activity* is the record of everything above.
   *
   * Every panel is still mounted and hidden rather than unmounted, so a
   * half-filled invite survives a look at the audit log — and so the panels
   * that fetch their own settings do it once per visit rather than once per
   * tab.
