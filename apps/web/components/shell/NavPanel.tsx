/**
 * The left panel — how you reach a place, never what decides whether the place
 * will speak to you.
 *
 * `doc/14` §0. This is the navigation that replaces the department **tab rail**,
 * and the two are not the same thing: the rail sat inside a director page and
 * gated the surface, so leaving it in place would have meant a founder choosing
 * a department before the product would say anything. The panel is global, the
 * surface underneath it is common, and every department it lists is one the
 * caller can already open.
 *
 * ## Grouped by what a thing is, not by what it is called
 *
 * The reference mock this replaces carried thirty-two sidebar entries in five
 * feature groups, which is a list that grows once per capability — ninety of
 * them, eventually. These four groups are fixed: a person, their directors,
 * their own data, and their settings. The product filling in does not lengthen
 * it.
 *
 * ## Composed, never greyed
 *
 * `all.directors` is already scoped by the API — a department the caller cannot
 * reach is absent from the response, not flagged in it. So a Marketing-only
 * contributor gets one entry under Directors and the group simply shrinks.
 * Rendering the other six disabled would advertise what somebody cannot have,
 * which is the disclosure this codebase refuses everywhere else it decides
 * between 404 and 403.
 *
 * ## `null` is *unknown*, and now renders as unknown
 *
 * The audit caught this panel breaking `AppShell`'s own stated rule. `all` is
 * `null` for the twelve to sixteen seconds `/api/dashboards` takes, and the
 * group was simply omitted for that whole time — so the sidebar said "you hold
 * no departments", which is exactly the absence the shell's documentation says
 * a consumer must never state during a load. It then grew by seven rows when
 * the fetch landed, moving everything under it.
 *
 * `null` now renders `NavSkeleton`, which reserves the height the real list
 * will occupy. Nothing is claimed, and nothing jumps.
 *
 * ## Counts
 *
 * A director with unanswered questions carries the number. It is the one piece
 * of information that changes what a reader would click, and it was already in
 * the payload (`unanswered_questions`) and thrown away. `undefined` means the
 * API did not say — rendered as nothing, never as zero.

 * panels inside setup and settings. A nav entry pointing at a route nobody
