/**
 * The left panel, and the two rules that are not obvious from looking at it.
 *
 * **It is composed, never greyed.** The API returns only the directors a caller
 * may open, so the panel renders what it is given. A version that drew all
 * seven and disabled six would advertise what somebody cannot have — the same
 * disclosure this codebase refuses every time it chooses 404 over 403 — and it
 * would do so on every page, permanently.
 *
 * **Exactly one entry is the current page.** `/dashboard` is a prefix of every
 * director path, so the naive check lights up *Today* alongside *Marketing* and
 * a screen reader announces two locations.
 *
 * `usePathname` is stubbed rather than routed: this is testing the panel's
 * rules, and standing a router up would test Next's.
