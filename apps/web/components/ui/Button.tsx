/**
 * Every button in the product.
 *
 * ## What the audit changed
 *
 * **A disabled primary action is no longer the default state of a form.** Both
 * `/login` and the onboarding conversation rendered their only call to action
 * at `opacity-50` with `disabled` set, before the reader had typed anything.
 * That fails twice over: it is the lowest-contrast thing on the screen at the
 * moment it is the most important, and it gives no indication of *what* would
 * enable it. Forms now keep the button live and validate on submit — copy the
 * pattern `LoginForm` uses — and where a control genuinely cannot act, `disabledReason`
 * is a sentence rendered as a **visible sibling** of the button, not a reason
 * to disable it.
 *
 * **R-03/X-02/X-03: `disabledReason` used to disable the button and hide its
 * own explanation inside it.** Setting the prop forced `disabled` — recreating
 * the exact default-disabled anti-pattern the paragraph above describes — and
 * the sentence was an `sr-only` span appended *inside* the `<button>`, after the
 * label. That corrupts the accessible name (the label plus the reason read as
 * one run-on sentence, or the whole thing reads as empty when `children` is
 * itself hidden while `loading`) and it is not what `aria-describedby` is for —
 * a description is a separate node the control merely *points at*, not content
 * folded into the name. And there never was a hover tooltip: `title` on a
 * `disabled` button does not receive pointer events in most browsers, so the
 * "shown on hover" claim that used to be here was simply false. `disabledReason`
 * now renders as its own element, given its own id, referenced by
 * `aria-describedby` on an **enabled** button — the reason is always visible,
 * always announced, and the click still fires so the caller can validate and
 * say what is wrong.
 *
 * **There is a loading state.** Six actions in this product take eight to
 * fifteen seconds (`Waiting` documents why). Every one of them used to leave
 * its button looking idle, so the honest response to a slow save was to press
 * it again. `loading` swaps the label for the caller's `loadingLabel`, sets
 * `aria-busy`, and blocks the click without going grey — a control that is
 * working is not a control that is unavailable, and the two must not look the
 * same.
 *
 * **Hover no longer moves the button.** `hover:-translate-y-0.5` on a control
 * whose neighbour does not move makes a toolbar shuffle as the pointer crosses
 * it. Depth still changes on hover; position does not. A press does move, by
 * one pixel, because that is feedback on an action rather than decoration on a
 * hover.
 *
 * ## Sizes
 *
 * `sm` exists for controls inside a dense row and is 36px — above the 24px
 * WCAG 2.5.8 floor but below a comfortable target, so it is only for a control
 * that sits in a row of its own kind. `md` (44px) is the default and meets the
 * touch-target minimum on every platform. `lg` (56px) is a page's single
 * primary action.
