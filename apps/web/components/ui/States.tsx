/**
 * Empty, error and success states — the three the audit found either missing or
 * dead-ended.
 *
 * ## Empty states must carry the action that fills them
 *
 * The dashboard's first card read "No audit has run yet — no page has been
 * fetched for this workspace… The audit runs once a website is added and
 * crawled." Every word of that is true and useful, and there was **no way to
 * add a website from it**. An empty state that names its own precondition and
 * then does not offer it makes the reader go and look for the setting, which is
 * the one thing the empty state existed to prevent.
 *
 * So `Empty` takes an `action` and it is not optional by accident: a state with
 * genuinely nothing to do passes `action={null}` explicitly, which is a
 * decision rather than an omission.
 *
 * ## Error states must offer a retry
 *
 * The Company Brain panel ended the dashboard with "Could not load what NEXUS
 * is working from. Nothing above is affected — this panel reads from a separate
 * place, and it is the reading that failed rather than the brain." The copy is
 * excellent: it says what failed, what is unaffected, and where the boundary
 * is. It had no button. A reader who wants to try again has to reload a page
 * that takes sixteen seconds and refetches twenty-five other things.
 *
 * `Failed` therefore requires `onRetry` *or* an explicit `retry={null}` for the
 * cases where retrying cannot help.
 *
 * ## The illustration is a glyph, not a picture
 *
 * The brief warns against large unnecessary illustrations, and an empty state
 * is where they breed. These draw one 40px mark in a tinted tile — enough to
 * make the state feel designed rather than broken, small enough that it never
 * competes with the sentence or the button.
