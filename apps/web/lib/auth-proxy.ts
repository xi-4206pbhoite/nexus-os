/**
 * Server-side proxy for the auth endpoints.
 *
 * The browser never learns the API's address and there is no CORS surface —
 * the reasoning the Preview proxy was built on, and the reason this pattern
 * outlived it. For auth it buys something further.
 * The session cookie is `httponly` and `SameSite=Lax`, and both properties only
 * hold if the cookie belongs to the origin the browser is actually talking to.
 * Calling the API directly from the page would make every auth request
 * cross-origin, which means CORS with credentials and `SameSite=None` — and
 * `SameSite=None` is precisely the protection the API deliberately relies on
 * (see `app/auth/csrf.py`). Proxying keeps the cookie first-party.
 *
 * Two directions of forwarding, and both matter:
 *
 * - **Upstream**: the browser's `Cookie` header and its `X-CSRF-Token`. Without
 *   the cookie the API cannot resolve the session; without the header its
 *   double-submit check rejects every state-changing call.
 * - **Downstream**: `Set-Cookie`. Building a fresh response drops all upstream
 *   headers, and dropping this one means login appears to succeed while setting
 *   no session at all.
 *
 * This route adds no checks of its own. Every guard — password verification,
 * session resolution, CSRF, membership visibility — lives in the API, and this
 * file must never be mistaken for the place they happen.

 * **This raises the ceiling; it does not fix the round trips.** #23 stays open

 * co-located and the same request costs milliseconds, so a timeout this high
 * should never be reached. It exists so development against a remote database
 * is possible, and so a slow request fails as slow rather than as broken.
 *
 * Configurable because the right value differs by deployment, and a constant
 * compiled into the bundle cannot be tuned by the person who feels the problem.
