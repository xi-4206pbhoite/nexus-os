 * An `AbortController` per effect run, aborted automatically on cleanup and

 *
 * `RegisterCompanyForm`'s department fetch used to guard its cleanup with a
 * `live` boolean, which stops the stale response from being applied but does
 * nothing to the request itself — under React 18 Strict Mode's
 * mount/unmount/remount the effect still fires the fetch twice. `useAbortable`
 * gives an effect a fresh `AbortSignal` each time it runs and cancels the
 * previous one, so the in-flight request is actually cancelled rather than
 * merely ignored.

/** Tracks which of the given section ids is currently in view. */
/**
 * Which section the reader is looking at.
 *
 * ## Why this is not an IntersectionObserver any more
 *
 * It was, and it reported the wrong section — reproducibly. Scrolling *down*
 * from Pillars into Moments moved the nav indicator *back* to "Your team", and
 * it stayed on "Pricing" through the whole FAQ.
 *
 * The cause is that the old implementation sorted the intersecting entries by
 * `intersectionRatio` and took the highest. `intersectionRatio` is a fraction
 * of **the observed element's own size**, so it is not comparable between
 * elements of different heights — and these differ by a factor of three.
 * Inside the 10%-of-viewport band the old `rootMargin` left, Pillars (1,898px
 * tall) scores about 0.05 while Moments (732px) scores 0.12. The shorter
 * section wins the sort whenever both are in the band, whichever one the reader
 * is actually in. The second defect compounded it: an observer callback
 * receives only the entries whose intersection *changed* in that batch, so the
 * comparison was frequently between one fresh entry and nothing at all.
 *
 * A position test has neither problem. The active section is the last one whose
 * top has passed a line 40% down the viewport — which is a direct statement of
 * "the section the reader is reading", needs no comparison between elements,
 * and cannot disagree with itself.
 *
 * Read inside `requestAnimationFrame` so a scroll burst costs one layout read
 * per frame rather than one per event, and `passive: true` so the listener can
 * never delay the scroll it is watching.
