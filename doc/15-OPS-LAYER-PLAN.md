# doc 15 — The ops layer

**Narrows:** `doc/14` step 10, which named this and deferred it.
**Depends on:** ADR 0030 (coverage), ADR 0033 (a figure that is not a score).
**Blocks:** 23 capabilities — more than accounting, and the largest single dependency in
the registry.

---

## 0. What it is, and the sentence that shapes everything below

`domain/sources.py` already says the important thing, in the entry's own
`cannot_answer`:

> *"anything nobody recorded — **this one fails on adoption, not on an API**"*

Every other source fails on integration: a missing key, a revoked token, a provider that
does not answer. Those are our problems and they have technical fixes. The ops layer fails
when a founder does not type anything into it, which no amount of engineering repairs.

**That is not a reason to build it carefully later. It is the design constraint now**,
because the failure mode is not an empty screen. It is a half-full one.

### The half-adoption problem

A founder records three of their twelve projects. `operations.projects_board` shows three,
which is true. `operations.on_time_dispatch` then computes *"67% on time"* over a third of
reality — a **wrong number with a plausible denominator**, which is precisely the failure
this product exists to prevent, arriving from our own feature rather than from a model.

Crawl and CRM do not have this problem: a crawl reads the page that exists, and a CRM is
authoritative about its own deals by construction. The ops layer is the first source where
**we cannot tell a complete record from a partial one** without asking.

So the first thing this plan needs is not a projects table. It is an answer to *how does
the ops layer know whether it holds everything?* — **D29**, below.

---

## 1. `ops_layer` is not one thing

The ten capabilities that need **only** `ops_layer` — no connector at all — describe at
least seven distinct record types:

| Capability | Needs | Also consumes |
|---|---|---|
| `operations.projects_board` | **projects** — status, progress, at-risk | |
| `operations.task_queue` | **tasks** — assignee, due, overdue | |
| `operations.milestone_timeline` | **milestones** on projects | |
| `operations.issue_register` | **issues** — severity, owner | |
| `operations.on_time_dispatch` | **dispatches** against a promised lead time | `promised_lead_time`, `late_definition` |
| `operations.stock_levels` | **stock items** — on hand against minimum | `stock_posture` |
| `operations.supplier_risk` | **suppliers** — concentration, on-time rate | `supplier_concentration` |
| `sales.deals_lite` | **deals**, "for customers with no CRM" | |
| `operations.score_drivers` | a composite over the above | |
| `executive.todays_priorities` | a ranking across all of it | |

The thirteen others pair `ops_layer` with `accounting`, `crm`, `roster`, `history` or a
tender feed, so none of them can be reached by this work alone.

**Building "the ops layer" as one step is the mistake `doc/14` deferred this to avoid.**
Seven entities, three of which also need onboarding answers, one of which overlaps a table
that already exists, and two of which are composites over the rest.

---

## 2. What changes architecturally

**NEXUS becomes a system of record.** Every source to date is read: a crawl we perform, a
provider we query, answers a founder gave once during onboarding. The ops layer is the
first place a customer **writes into NEXUS and expects it back**, which brings surface this
codebase has never needed:

- Write endpoints with validation, and an audit trail for who changed what — `audit.py`
  exists and has never had to cover customer records.
- `SourceEntry.read_only` is `True` for every connector, and A5 makes write scope a
  separate, heavier ask. That rule is about *other people's systems*; this is about ours,
  and the distinction should be written down rather than assumed.
- Concurrent editing. Two people in one workspace updating the same project is ordinary,
  and the cheap answer — last write wins — silently discards somebody's work.

None of that is hard. All of it is new, and it is why this is a plan rather than a step.

---

## 3. The decisions this surfaces

**D29 — How does the ops layer know it holds everything?** *(blocks every figure)*
Without an answer, a partial record produces a complete-looking percentage. Options: ask
(*"is this all of them?"* per entity, with a date), infer from staleness (nothing added in
N days means we stop computing rates), compute only counts and never rates until the
customer confirms completeness, or mark every ops figure `self_reported` — `doc/05` §0
already has that state, and it exists precisely so a number somebody typed never looks like
one we measured. **My recommendation: `self_reported` plus an explicit completeness
question per entity**, because the two answer different halves — the state says where the
number came from, the question says whether it covers everything.

**D30 — Does `sales.deals_lite` reuse `crm_deal`?** It is described as *"a minimal deal
tracker for customers with no CRM"*, and `crm_deal` already exists with a `provider`
column. Writing them as `provider = 'nexus'` would make `calculators/pipeline.py` work for
both with no new code — and would also mean a hand-typed deal and a synced one sit in one
table, which the `self_reported` distinction says they should not. **Recommendation: reuse
the table, carry the provenance in `provider`, and let the figure's kind differ.** Worth
disagreeing with.

**D31 — Is `operations.score_drivers` a composite, and is it allowed?** It shows *"Score,
delta"* for a department. ADR 0029 and 0030 both refuse a composite over thin coverage at
company level; the same argument applies one level down, and this is the first department
score the product would draw.

---

## 4. Slices

Each delivers a tile a founder can open. None is "build the ops layer".

### S10.1 — Projects and tasks ✅ *shipped 17 September 2026*
The two everything else hangs off. `operations.projects_board` and
`operations.task_queue`, both `ops_layer`-only, both counts rather than rates — so they
are the one pair that can ship **before D29 is answered**, because a count of what was
recorded is true whether or not it is complete.
**Acceptance:** a founder creates a project and a task through the app; both tiles render
from the database; a second member of the workspace sees them and a member of another
workspace does not.

**Asserted by `scripts/ops_walkthrough.py`** — the whole sentence in order, over HTTP,
against Neon: 26 checks, green. Migration `0032` (`ops_project`, `ops_task`, RLS forced);
`retrieval/ops.py`, `calculators/ops.py`, `routes/ops.py`, `/work` and its five BFF
routes. ADR 0034 adds the **count** figure kind, because a count is neither a score nor
an amount and rendering it as either would have put a money shape with no money, or a
denominator, on a tile that has neither. `OPS_LAYER` joins `connected_sources` when rows
exist, which makes these the first capabilities in the product that can reach `live`.

Four things this slice found that were not about the ops layer at all:

- **The Morning Brief called a figured tile unmeasured.** Only a scored audit yields a
  `Computation`, so `sales.pipeline_board` had been announced as *"This could not be
  measured"* above the tile showing its number since ADR 0033. `compose` now takes
  `also_measured`.
- **`coverage` was injected with one dispatch.** The route and its test both passed
  `CRAWL_AUDITS`, so they agreed with each other and not with the product;
  `grounding.compute.MEASURABLE` is now the single set both use.
- **Three standfirsts promised a denominator** the amount and count kinds do not have.
- **The BFF had no `/api/ops` route**, so the page said "Could not read what you have
  recorded" while the whole layer worked end to end. Neither suite can see this — vitest
  mocks `fetch` and pytest calls the API directly. The browser found it.

### S10.2 — Completeness, per D29 ✅ *shipped 17 September 2026*
The answer, applied to the two tiles that already exist. Nothing else should be built until
this is settled, because every later capability is a rate.

**D29 is decided — both halves (ADR 0035).** A completeness question per entity, stored
with a date and append-only, plus self-reported provenance on every ops figure.
Migration `0033` adds `ops_completeness` (RLS forced); `/work` asks *"Is this all of your
projects?"* per entity and the tile turns the answer into a sentence — either *"You
confirmed this is all of them, as of 11 September"* or *"You have not said whether this is
all of them, so this counts the record rather than the company."*

`calculators/completeness.may_compute_a_rate` is the gate, written now though the first
ops rate is S10.4: a rule added after the code it governs is one added after somebody has
already shipped around it.

One correction to the wording of D29's recommendation, argued in ADR 0035: the provenance
travels **on the figure**, not as `WidgetState.SELF_REPORTED`. That state renders quoted
text and no figure (`doc/13` §7, and `hasFigure` returns `false` for it), so setting it
would have blanked the counts S10.1 shipped — and it needs to keep its meaning for D7.

Asserted by `scripts/ops_walkthrough.py`: 34 checks, green, including that confirming
projects does not vouch for tasks and that a confirmation adds no rate to the figure.

### S10.3 — Milestones and issues ✅ *shipped 17 September 2026*
`operations.milestone_timeline`, `operations.issue_register`. Both hang off a project.

Migration `0034` adds `ops_milestone` and `ops_issue` (RLS forced on both) and widens
`ck_ops_completeness_entity` to four entities, so D29's question is now asked of these two
as well.

**`project_id` differs between them, and that is not an oversight.** A milestone's is
`NOT NULL` — a milestone is a point in a project's plan, and one without a project is not
a milestone, it is a date. An issue's is nullable, for `ops_task`'s reason: requiring one
would make somebody invent a project to record a snag, and an invented project then counts
on `projects_board`.

**`planned_on` is `NOT NULL`**, the only required date in the layer. doc/05 6.3 is
*"milestones with planned dates"*, and a milestone with no date is the one thing a
timeline cannot draw — it would silently join the `undated` count on a tile whose whole
subject is when things happen. There is deliberately **no `missed` status**: a missed
milestone is a planned date in the past that nobody marked done, which the calculator
already works out, and storing it too would let the two disagree.

**The issue register is the first figure with a breakdown** — open issues per severity,
worst first. Still a count: ADR 0034 forbids dividing, not grouping, and three counts side
by side say what to look at first without implying a proportion. Every band is rendered
even at zero, because *"no high-severity issues"* is the reassuring thing a reader came
for and an absent row makes them count the list to be sure. The order is the server's;
sorting in the browser would put "high" between "low" and "medium".

Asserted by `scripts/ops_walkthrough.py`: 49 checks, green.

### S10.4 — Dispatches ✅ *shipped 17 September 2026*
`operations.on_time_dispatch` — the first ops **rate**, and the first to need onboarding
answers (`promised_lead_time`, `late_definition`). D29 must be answered before it.

**The onboarding answers turned out to be unusable, and that is D32 (ADR 0036).** Both
facts are collected as free prose — `late_definition` is typed `SINGLE_CHOICE` with no
choices defined, and `AnswerShape.DURATION` is only a *cue* that helps the agent phrase
the question. There is no parser anywhere, and writing one would be inventing a threshold
from somebody's sentence. So the rule is asked for as a **number**:
`workspace.dispatch_grace_days`, nullable with **no server default** — a `DEFAULT 0`
would be a threshold we set for every workspace, silently, producing a confident
percentage under a rule the customer never agreed to.

**Two gates, refusing for different reasons**, and the tile says which: nobody has vouched
the record is complete (ADR 0035), or nobody has said what late means (D32). A third state,
`nothing_sent`, is named separately because the customer has done everything asked and
there is still nothing to divide. **No percentage is served under any of them, and neither
is half a fraction** — half a fraction is an invitation to finish it.

**The counts ship under every refusal.** Orders outstanding and past the promise are true
without either gate, and withholding them along with the rate would tell a founder nothing
when we can honestly tell them something.

`RateFigureOut` is the union's fourth arm (score, amount, count, rate). The denominator is
**what actually went out**, never what was recorded: dividing by the latter reports a
backlog as lateness.

**Still not narratable, and this one is a bounded gap rather than a principle.** A rate has
exactly `narrate-metric`'s vocabulary. What stops it is `domain.narration.describes`, which
is typed to `Computation` and compares a `page` a rate has no equivalent of — and that
comparison is the only thing keeping prose about last week's number beside this week's.

Asserted by `scripts/ops_walkthrough.py`: 67 checks, green, including both gates refusing
in turn and the figure moving when the founder widens the grace.

### S10.5 — Stock and suppliers ✅ *shipped 17 September 2026*
`operations.stock_levels`, `operations.supplier_risk`. Each consumes a fact.

Migration `0036` adds `ops_stock_item` and `ops_supplier` (RLS forced) and widens
`ck_ops_completeness_entity` to the **seven** entities this plan always implied.

**The pair makes the layer's dividing line visible.** Stock is a *count* — "3 of 12 below
their minimum" is true whether or not the record is complete, so the tile works from the
first row. Concentration is a *share*, so it stands behind D29's gate exactly as the
on-time figure does: three of ten suppliers recorded would otherwise report one of them as
60% of the company's exposure.

**Neither fact is consumed, and the records answer them instead.** `stock_posture` ("do
you hold stock, or order per job?") and `supplier_concentration` ("which supplier are you
most exposed to?") are both free prose, like D32's pair. Recording a stock line *is* the
answer to the first; the second asks for a judgement NEXUS now computes, which is the
better way round.

**Ordered by consequence means the shortfall, not the ratio.** Two items each one unit
short — one with a minimum of two, one of two hundred — are the same order to place. A
ratio would also divide by a minimum of zero, a legitimate value meaning "hold none of
this", and rank an item nobody wants above everything else.

**Nothing suggests a reorder quantity**, which would need lead times and consumption this
layer does not hold, and **nothing grades the exposure**: whether 40% with one supplier is
dangerous depends on how replaceable they are, which nobody has told us.

Two shapes had to generalise, both mine from S10.4 — recorded as **ADR 0037**, which
amends ADR 0036's description of the rate figure: `RateComputation` held the dispatch
calculator's own type, and `CountFigureOut` hard-coded "still open" — wrong for stock,
where the same field counts lines under a level. They now carry `RateParts` and an
`open_label`.

Asserted by `scripts/ops_walkthrough.py`: 83 checks, green.

### S10.6 — Deals-lite, per D30 ✅ *shipped 17 September 2026*

**D30 decided: reuse `crm_deal`, partitioned by provenance (ADR 0038).** Hand-typed deals
are `provider = 'nexus'` rows. **No migration** — the column exists, carries no CHECK, and
the unique key already includes it — and `calculators/pipeline.py` is untouched, which was
the whole argument for reuse.

**The partition is what makes reuse safe, and it is the part that was easy to skip.**
`current_deals` previously selected *every* `crm_deal` row and labelled it `provider="crm"`.
Adding typed rows without touching that query would have fed somebody's own typing into
`sales.pipeline_board` as though a CRM had reported it — silently, with no symptom. So
`current_deals` reads `provider <> 'nexus'` and `current_typed_deals` reads the rest.

**The kind is the same and the standing differs.** Both figures are amounts;
`AmountFigureOut.self_reported` decides whether the tile says "Read from your CRM" or
"Counted from what you recorded". Splitting the union again would spend its one mechanism
on something that is not a new kind.

Asserted by `scripts/ops_walkthrough.py`: 91 checks, green, including that the CRM tile
does not see the typed deals at all.

**⚠️ This slice tipped `/dashboards/surface` past the BFF's 30-second timeout on the
development machine.** Measured directly against the API: **31–37 s** for the surface and
**13 s** for `/ops`. The cause is round-trip count, not any one query — the surface now
makes roughly fourteen sequential statements, nine of them `current_ops`, against a Neon
instance this machine reaches in ~2 s per statement. S10.5 rendered; S10.6 added one read
and crossed the line. Co-located with the database this would be well under a second, but
fourteen sequential round trips for one page is a design problem regardless of where the
database sits. **Fixed immediately after, in ADR 0039**: `current_ops` is now one statement with nine
`json_agg` subqueries instead of nine statements, which brought the surface to 17–20 s and
`/ops` to 7–9 s — under the timeout, and still not fast. Five round trips remain on the
surface and the same argument applies to them.

### S10.7 — The composites, per D31 ✅ *shipped 17 September 2026*
`operations.score_drivers` and `executive.todays_priorities`. Last, because a ranking
across departments is only honest once the things it ranks exist.

**D31 decided: drivers, no score (ADR 0040).** The argument that refused a company
composite was *thin coverage*, and that no longer applies — Operations is the best-covered
department in the product. A different and stronger one does: **all seven inputs are the
customer's own records**, so one number over them measures how diligently somebody types.
A founder who records everything and runs a shaky business scores well; one who runs a
tight business and records a third of it is told their operations are the problem.

So the tile names the seven figures, says in words why it does not average them, and
leaves each to speak on its own — the shape `on_time_dispatch` already uses when it shows
its counts and withholds its percentage. The offering's `shows` changed from *"Score,
delta"* to match, because the old wording rendered directly above the sentence denying it.

**`todays_priorities` is a composition, not a composite**, which ADR 0029 already
distinguished: every row points at one record a founder can open, and nothing is totalled.
It ranks by **days past a date somebody set** — one unit across tasks, milestones, orders
and dated issues, so the ordering compares like with like. A severe issue with no date and
a stock line under its minimum are returned **beside** the ranking, each ordered by its own
measure, because folding them in would need a rule turning severity into days that nobody
has set.

Two new arms on the figure union (`drivers`, `priorities`) — both carrying no number of
their own, and both refused for narration for that reason.

Asserted by `scripts/ops_walkthrough.py`: 103 checks, green. The walkthrough caught the
drivers tile rendering for a workspace that had recorded nothing, which every sibling tile
leaves `locked`; it is now gated on the snapshot like the rest.

**`doc/15` is complete.** All seven slices shipped, and D29, D30, D31 and D32 are answered.

---

## 5. Not in this plan

- **The thirteen capabilities that pair `ops_layer` with a connector.** They need
  `doc/14` S11 as well and are not unblocked by this work.
- **Importing projects from anywhere.** An ops layer that could import from Asana or
  Monday would be a connector, and a different plan; this is for customers who have
  nothing.
- **Notifications, assignment workflows, comments.** A project-management product is not
  what the 23 capabilities need — they need records to compute from, and every feature
  beyond that is one more thing to adopt before any figure appears.
