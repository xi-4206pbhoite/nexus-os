"""The two non-vendor providers: unconfigured, and deterministic for tests.

Neither invents content. That is the whole point of both of them.

A "demo mode" that returns plausible-sounding analysis would be the single most
damaging thing this codebase could contain. The product's entire position is
that a number on the screen was fetched or computed and can be traced back to
its source; a fabricated paragraph that reads like a real recommendation
destroys that whether or not it is labelled, because the label is on the screen
and the screenshot is in the customer's email.

So `UnavailableProvider` refuses, and `ScriptedProvider` returns only what a
test explicitly told it to.
