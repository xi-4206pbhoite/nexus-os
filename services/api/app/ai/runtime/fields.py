"""The declared field catalogue: what a skill is allowed to write, and at what scope.

This file is the answer to the objection ADR 0019 raised against generated
questions. That ADR blocked them because "a generated question has no scope tag,
so its answer has nowhere honest to go" — and it was right about the failure, not
about the only possible fix.

The fix here is to invert where the tag comes from. A generated question does not
carry a scope tag *of its own*; it must **name a field from this catalogue**, and
the field carries the tag. `question-generation` returns `{question, target}` and
the runtime rejects any turn whose `target` is not a key below — before the
question is ever put to a person. So the model chooses the wording, the ordering
and the follow-up, and the sensitivity of the answer is still decided in
deterministic code that a reviewer can read in one screen.

Two consequences worth stating, because both are load-bearing:

**A question the catalogue cannot express cannot be asked.** That is the point.
Adding a field is a deliberate edit to this file with a scope on it, not a
side-effect of a model deciding a new topic is interesting.

**Persona fields never widen access.** `doc/06` §2.6: "No persona field is ever an
input to the retrieval predicate." Everything below with `kind=PERSONA` is
presentation preference, stored at L5, and `assert_persona_is_not_authorisation()`
fails the import if a role-shaped key is ever added. `persona_chat.py` expresses
the same rule as `never_asked`; this expresses it as a type the runtime enforces.

    """The *form* a field's answer takes, when it has a recognisable one.

    This exists to catch a specific defect: a question whose wording cannot
    possibly elicit the field it is bound to. The architecture's central promise
    is that binding an answer to a declared field makes it "a cited fact rather
    than loose text" — but nothing checked that the *question* matched the
    field's intent, so when it did not, the wrong meaning was stored with full
    provenance and downstream agents read it as authoritative.

    Three cases from an audit of seven interviews, all still reachable after the
    catalogue was narrowed by department, because each is the *right* department
    and the wrong field inside it:

    - `runway_alarm` means "how many months of runway would change your plans".
      It was asked "what's the gap that causes the most friction right now?" —
      so a free-text complaint was stored as a runway threshold. The next
      question then said "when you hit that nine-month runway threshold",
      attributing to the person a number she had never given.
    - `brain.competitors` means "who you actually lose to". It was asked about
      channel economics.
    - `distrusted_number` means "a figure they do not currently believe". It was
      asked "what slows you down".

    A shape is a much weaker claim than "does this question mean the same as
    this intent", and deliberately so — it is checkable without a second model
    call. `PROSE` is the default and is never checked: you cannot structurally
    mismatch a prose question against a prose field.

    the mismatches the gates were added to prevent.

    Most are lifted verbatim from `domain/question_bank.py`, which has held

    the product's central restraint — do not ask what you can read — so it is
    enforced by the filter rather than by asking the model nicely.

    **`department` is the second restraint, and it used to be missing.** This
    function took no argument, so every one of the askable fields was offered
    to every user and the department they gave at signup reached the model as
    prose advice only — "a Head of Sales should not be walked through the
    finance fields first". An audit of seven end-to-end runs measured how well
    that held: **26% of questions were bound to a field belonging to a
    different department.** A Head of People was asked what disqualifies a
    sales deal; a Chief of Staff spent three of five questions on CRM
    mechanics; a hiring answer was written into `fact.sales.disqualifier`,
    where any sales dashboard would read it as deal policy.

    it is shown:

    - every `brain.*` and `persona.*` field, because those are company-wide and
      belong to whoever is answering; and
    - the `fact.*` fields of **their** department, and no other.

    `department` of None means nobody said — a user with no `stated_department`
    — and the honest response is to offer every department's facts rather than
    none, exactly as `runs_department` treats an empty selection as "nothing has
    been ruled out". Narrowing to zero would leave the interview with only
    narrative fields, which is the other half of what the audit found wrong.
