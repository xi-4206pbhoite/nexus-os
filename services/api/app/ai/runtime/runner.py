"""Running a skill: build the request, validate the answer, refuse the rest.

The pipeline is doc 06 §8's, unchanged: fetch and compute deterministically,
make **one** model call, validate the response against the skill's schema, retry
exactly once, then give up honestly. Not exponential backoff across many
attempts — a call that fails twice should surface as unavailable rather than be
retried until the budget is gone.

Three things this enforces that a prompt cannot:

**Declared grounding.** A skill that lists `requires_grounding` will not run
without those values. Without the check, a caller who forgot one gets a model
that invents it instead, and I1 is broken quietly rather than loudly.

**Declared writes.** Every `target` the model returns is checked against the
skill's manifest *and* the field catalogue. A skill cannot write a field it did
not declare, whatever the model returns.

**Schema, twice.** `output_config.format` constrains the response at decode time
and the runner validates it again on receipt. That is not belt-and-braces for its
own sake: the second check is what produces the failure rate worth watching, and
a provider that validated for us would swallow it.
