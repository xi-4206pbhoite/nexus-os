"""Creating a company — the authenticated product's entry point.

`doc/12` §Phase 5. Until now the only path that inserted a `workspace` was
`create_workspace_for_claim`, which required a verified domain first (doc 07 M3).
D19 split that: **creation needs no claim**, and verification gates inviting and
connecting instead. `app/auth/workspaces.py` argues why.

One transaction, three rows — `tenant`, `workspace`, owner `membership` — plus a
queued `research_run`. Atomic because a workspace with no members is unreachable
by everyone including the person who just made it, and there is no path in the
product to add the first one.
