"""Domain claims and the workspace-creation gate.

**The invariant: no workspace exists without a verified domain.**

It is enforced in one function — `create_workspace_for_claim` — which is the
only path that inserts a workspace. Spreading the check across route handlers
would make it a convention; here it is a precondition, and the test that
attempts to bypass it has one place to attack.

First verified wins (doc 06 §1.1). The database enforces that with the partial
unique index on `lower(domain) WHERE domain_verified_at IS NOT NULL` from
migration 0002, so a race between two claimants is resolved by Postgres rather
than by application timing. The loser enters a dispute rather than silently
failing or, worse, silently succeeding into a second workspace for the same
company.
