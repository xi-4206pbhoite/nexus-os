"""Issuing and accepting invitations.

The rule this exists to make structural is doc 06 §2.2: *"Every subsequent
user's role is set by the inviter, never self-declared at acceptance."*

Look at `accept` and note what it does **not** take. There is no `role`
parameter and no `departments` parameter, so there is no version of this
function that a caller could talk into granting something the inviter did not
set. The role is read from the row the inviter wrote and copied into the
membership. That is the difference between a rule and a convention.

Tokens are hashed at rest and single-use, for the same reason session and
verification tokens are: a leaked database must not yield working invitation
links, and an accepted link must not seat a second person.
