"""Password reset.

The same machinery as `email_verification` — hashed at rest, single-use,
expiring — with three differences that come from the blast radius. A stolen
verification token confirms an address. **A stolen reset token is the account.**

- **A shorter life.** One hour, not twenty-four. The window in which a token
  sitting in an inbox, a proxy log or a browser history is redeemable is the
  window this exists to make small.
- **Requesting one supersedes any outstanding token.** Otherwise every reset a
  user has ever requested stays live until it expires, and the oldest forwarded
  email still works.
- **Confirming one revokes every live session.** The ordinary reason to reset a
  password is that somebody else has it. Leaving their session alive makes the
  reset a formality: they keep exactly the access it was performed to remove.

Nothing here tells a caller whether an address exists. That is the *route's*
job — see `app/routes/auth.py` — but it constrains this module too: `request`
returns `None` for an unknown address rather than raising, so the caller has no
exception to accidentally turn into a distinguishable response.
