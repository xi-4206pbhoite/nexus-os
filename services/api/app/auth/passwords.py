# ── Off the event loop (finding #1, P4) ───────────────────────
#
# argon2id is deliberately expensive: ~40-80 ms of *synchronous* CPU per call,
# by design, because that is what defeats offline cracking. Called directly from
# an `async def` it holds the only thread the event loop has, so thirty login
# attempts a second against a non-existent account stall **every** endpoint —
# dashboards, uploads, and `/health`, which is how a load balancer decides the
# process is dead. The attacker does not need a valid account: the dummy-hash
# equaliser above means a guess at an unknown address costs exactly as much.
#
# It compounds with the rate limit rather than being fixed by it, which is why
# `doc/12` §Phase 4 pairs them: backoff makes each attacker slower, and moving
# the work off the loop is what stops the attempts they do make from taking the
# service down with them.
