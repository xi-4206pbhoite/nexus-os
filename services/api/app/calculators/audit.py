"""Preview audit scoring. Pure functions, no IO, no model.

**I1 — never invent a number.** Every score here is arithmetic over observed
signals, and every one returns the checks that produced it. **I9 — every number
is auditable**: the trace *is* the answer to "why are you telling me this?", so
it is returned alongside the score rather than reconstructed later.

Three categories only. Doc 06 §1.1 limits the pre-verification Preview to brand,
performance and technical SEO on the entered domain — no competitor discovery,
no keyword data, because those have intelligence value about third parties and
sit behind domain verification.

**Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations and People are deliberately absent, not
zero.** Doc 05 §3.1 is explicit that Marketing is not scoreable without GA4, and
that Brand and SEO must not be merged into a Marketing score to manufacture a
number. A category with no evidence is `Locked`, never `0` (I10).
