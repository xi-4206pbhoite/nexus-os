"""Whether the ops layer has been vouched for. Pure, and the gate every rate passes.

`doc/15` S10.2, ADR 0035. The ops layer **fails on adoption, not on an API**:
nothing in the database distinguishes a founder who recorded three of twelve
projects from one who recorded twelve. A count survives that and a rate does
not, so a rate needs something the database cannot supply — somebody saying *"yes,
this is all of them"*.

## Why this is a module and not an `if`

The first ops rate is `doc/15` S10.4 and does not exist yet. The rule is written
before it anyway, because a rule added after the code it governs is a rule added
once somebody has already shipped around it — and the shape of that shipping is
a percentage on a screen, which is the one thing this product cannot take back.

## What it deliberately does not do

**It never judges whether a confirmation has gone stale.** A founder who
confirmed in March and stopped recording in April has a record we were told was
complete and probably is not. The mitigation is to report the date and let a
reader decide; an expiry after N days would be a threshold nobody set, and an
accurate list that simply stopped changing is indistinguishable from an
abandoned one. That was D29's staleness option, and ADR 0035 rejects it.

Per entity rather than once for the layer: somebody can plausibly have recorded
every project and a third of the tasks, and one switch covering both would let
the honest half vouch for the careless one. `doc/15` S10.3 added milestones and
issues, S10.4 dispatches, S10.5 stock and suppliers — seven, and the set doc/15 planned for.

**Dispatches are the first entity where this gate does real work.** For a count,
an unvouched record still reports something true. For `on_time_dispatch` — the
first rate — an unvouched denominator is the half-full record D29 exists to
catch.

Kept in step with `ck_ops_completeness_entity` by hand, and a database test
asserts the two agree — a value legal here and refused by the constraint is a
500 on a write somebody was told was fine.
