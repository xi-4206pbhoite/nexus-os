    region — where a round trip is a millisecond or two — the same setting costs
    about 2ms and is obviously worth it.

    way away and you would rather have the latency back.

    What you give up by turning it off: `db_pool_recycle_seconds` still discards
    connections *before* a provider's idle timeout, so the ordinary
    idle-close case is covered without it. The case it does not cover is a
    provider suspending its compute — Neon scales to zero — which kills
    connections of any age. There, the first request after a suspend fails once
