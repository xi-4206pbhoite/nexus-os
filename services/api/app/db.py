"""Database engine and session.

The engine is created lazily so the process can boot — and answer `/health` —
without a database. That matters operationally: liveness must not depend on a
dependency, or an outage becomes a restart loop.

Note what is deliberately absent. There is no `get_session()` that application
code may call freely. From M1, every read goes through `retrieval/`, which takes
a `ScopedSession` and applies the permission predicate as part of the query
(I2, I3). A bare session handed around the codebase is exactly the bypass those
invariants exist to prevent, so the accessor here is named to discourage it and
will become internal to `retrieval/` once that package exists.

    stock PostgreSQL, so it was green — but **Neon's proxy filters the startup
    packet to an allowlist and silently drops all three.** `SHOW

    Silently is the word that matters. Nothing errored, nothing logged, and

    the connection looked correctly configured from every angle except asking
    the server what it thought. ADR 0008 makes Neon the production database, so

    mattered (finding #15).

    Issued here instead, on the pool's `connect` event, which runs once per
    physical connection rather than once per checkout — so this costs one round
    trip per connection, not one per request.

    `set_config(name, value, false)` rather than `SET name = value`: `SET` takes
    no parameters, so the values would have to be interpolated into the SQL, and
    these come from configuration. `false` is the `is_local` flag, making the
