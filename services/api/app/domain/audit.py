"""The audit trail — I9's substrate.

Doc 07 I9: every state-changing action leaves a record naming who did it, to
what, and when. `audit_log` has existed since migration 0002 and **nothing has
ever written to it**, which is the ordinary way an audit requirement dies: the
table is there, the schema review passes, and the log is empty.

Three properties, and each is a decision rather than a detail.

**One row per action, written in the same transaction as the action.** Not
after, and not best-effort. A log written on a separate connection is a log that
disagrees with the data whenever one of the two fails — and the disagreement is
silent, which is worse than no log, because a reader trusts it.

**The workspace owns the record.** `audit_log.workspace_id` is `NOT NULL` and
carries the same isolation policy as every other workspace-scoped table, so the
log a workspace can read is exactly its own. That has a consequence worth
stating plainly rather than discovering later: **an action taken before any
workspace exists cannot be logged here.** Registering, verifying an email,
resetting a password and signing in with no membership all happen to an account
rather than to a company, and there is no tenant to own the row. A NULL
`workspace_id` would not fix it — the isolation predicate compares against the
GUC, so a NULL row is invisible to everyone, which is a log entry that exists
and cannot be read. Account-level auditing needs its own stream, and this
module deliberately does not pretend to be it.

**Reading it is a privilege.** Owner and Executive, nobody else — enforced in
`app/routes/audit.py`, not here, for the same reason `retrieval/` owns the
permission predicate: the boundary is the query, not the caller's manners.
