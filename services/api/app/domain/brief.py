"""The morning brief: what was found, ranked by what it cost.

ADR 0029. The first region of the common surface, and the one with the most
ways to quietly become something else.

## A ranking, not a recommendation

Order is points lost, descending — arithmetic the calculator already did.
`Check.evidence` is specified as *what was observed* and never as advice, and
this is the highest-traffic place that distinction gets tested: "0 of 37 images"
is a finding, "add alt text" is guidance nobody computed. The brief may say what
a check is **worth**, because the weight is a number in the code. It may not say
what to do about it.

**The check's own label is used verbatim**, not negated. A first draft of the
design wrote *"Not served over HTTPS"* for `seo.https`, which reads well and
generalises to nothing: the same transformation turns "Page has a title" into
"Not Page has a title". The label states the check, the item states that it
failed, and no sentence is manufactured in between.

## Found, never changed

Nothing re-crawls (M32), so there is no baseline. A brief headed with a date
range, or an item reading "new this week", would claim a comparison nobody made —
the failure `SKILL.md` forbids when it says never to call a delta flat. When
re-crawling lands, items gain a movement and this docstring is the thing to
read first.

## Three states, and two of them must not be mistakable

`FINDINGS` is the ranking. `ALL_HELD` is full marks **and its own limits in the
same breath**, because a brief saying "nothing needs you" would be a claim about
a business drawn from checks on one web page. `NOT_MEASURED` exists because an
audit that never ran must not read as an audit that found nothing — the region is
never hidden and never shows a zero (I10).

## No model, ever

This renders at the top of every page load for every workspace. A model-backed
brief could be empty, refused, or billed on a page somebody opened by accident,
and ADR 0011 makes a missing API key a supported state rather than a degraded
one. The copy below is templated and reads more mechanically than written prose
would; that is the trade, and it was made deliberately.

    `computations` is what actually produced a figure; `expected` is every
    capability this reader can reach that *should* have. The difference is the
    `UNMEASURED` band, and computing it here rather than in the route is what
    stops a capability silently disappearing from the brief when its calculator
    starts returning `None`.

    **Scoped by the caller, not here.** Both arguments arrive already filtered
    to what the reader may see (ADR 0029), so this function has no permission
    logic of its own to drift out of step with the route's.

    `unobserved` is coverage's `not_built` — the only number the copy borrows
    from outside, and only so the `ALL_HELD` state can state its own limits in
    the same sentence as the good news.

    **`also_measured` is every capability that produced a figure without
    producing checks.** `computations` are scored audits, and only a scored
    audit has failures to list — but a figure is a figure, and a capability
    absent from both sets lands in the `UNMEASURED` band. Without this, a tile
    carrying an amount (ADR 0033) or a count (ADR 0034) was announced as "this
