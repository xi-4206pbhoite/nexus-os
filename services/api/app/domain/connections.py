"""Which systems a company runs on, and what each one would unlock.

The tools step of onboarding. It sits after the interview and after the
documents, and it is the **last** thing that happens before the Persona and the
Company Brain are assembled — so what is recorded here is grounding the Brain is
built *with*, rather than a setting applied to a Brain that is already written.
That ordering is the point of the step existing at all: a Brain assembled before
anyone said "our pipeline is in HubSpot" has to guess where pipeline answers come
from, and it guesses in prose that reads as fact.

**Declaring is not connecting, and the column says which.** No OAuth exists yet
— `app/domain/connectors.py` records that the OAuth half waits on D3 (Google
credentials) and D10 (the CRM choice), and neither has landed. So what this step
collects today is the person naming their own stack, stored as
`ConnectionState.DECLARED`. Two things make that worth collecting rather than
worth deferring:

- It is grounding. "Deals live in Pipedrive, invoices in Xero" changes what the
  Brain should say about how this company runs, and it is a fact only the person
  has.
- It turns silence into a named gap. Every declared-but-unconnected tool becomes
  a `known_gap` carrying its own unlock, which is what `context.known_gaps` is
  for — a workspace that says "I cannot see your traffic until Analytics is
  connected" is in a different category from one whose traffic tile is empty.

When the OAuth half lands it moves the same row to `CONNECTED` and fills
`connected_at`. No migration, no second table, and no ambiguity about which
tools were ever actually reachable — that was the whole reason for putting the
lifecycle in one column instead of inferring "connected" from the row existing.

**Every `unlocks` is a capability, never a finding.** The same rule
`document_asks` is written under. "Answering pipeline questions from your own
deals" is a promise kept the moment the connection works; "you are losing 12% at
proposal stage" is a conclusion invented before anything has been read.

**The catalogue is closed, and the database agrees.**
`ck_workspace_connection_provider` holds the same ids as `PROVIDERS`, and
`test_constraint_enum_parity` compares the two on every run. A client cannot
declare `provider: "our internal thing"` and leave a row that nothing
downstream knows how to read.
