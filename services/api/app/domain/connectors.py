"""What a connection can and cannot compute, and what happens when it stops.

`doc/12` P18. The OAuth half waits on **D3** (Google credentials) and **D10**
(the CRM choice); this is everything that does not.

**Field completeness is checked at connect, not discovered later** (doc 05 §9).
A CRM without `last_activity_at` cannot support stale-deal detection, and the
difference between saying so at connect and letting the widget come up empty is
the difference between a limitation and a bug. The customer can act on the
first — add the field, or accept the gap — and can only lose confidence in the
second.

**A revoked token degrades to stale, never to zero.** The number we last saw was
real; what has stopped is our ability to refresh it. Rendering zero would claim
their pipeline emptied overnight, which is a statement about their business made
out of a statement about our access.
