"""Marketing's first real numbers: the audit scores, with their evidence.

`doc/12` P16. These are the first capabilities to flip `delivered` to true, and
what makes them safe to ship is that every one is arithmetic over something
observed on a page somebody can open.

**The scores are per-category and stay that way.** Brand and technical SEO are
never combined, and neither becomes a Marketing score — `calculators/audit.py`
says so in its own docstring and `tests/test_marketing_scoreability.py` makes it
a test. They measure the *website*: whether the title tags are sensible, whether
the pages load. Marketing performance is whether anybody arrived and what they
did, and a company with an immaculate site and no visitors would otherwise score
well on a metric named for the thing it is failing at.
