"""One person, one company.

`doc/11` §3.2 reversed the M:N assumption. A NEXUS account belongs to exactly
one company: a user with a live membership cannot create a second workspace, and
cannot accept an invitation into another one.

**The `membership` table stays many-to-many.** The rule is enforced here rather
than by a unique index, for two reasons:

- doc 06 §2.1's agency case — one operator, several client workspaces — is
  explicitly deferred rather than deleted, and a unique index would have to be
  migrated away again to bring it back.
- The rule is about *live* memberships. Someone who left a company must be able
  to join another, and a `UNIQUE (user_id)` cannot express "unless revoked"
  without becoming a partial index that then has to agree with application code
  anyway.

It lives in `app/domain/` and not in the two callers because a rule enforced at
each call site is a convention: the third caller forgets. Here there is one
place to attack and one place to audit — the same argument
`create_workspace_for_claim` makes for itself.
