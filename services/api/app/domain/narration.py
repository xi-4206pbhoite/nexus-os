"""A stored sentence, whether it still describes the figure, and what to say
when there is no sentence.

Pure. No session, no model, no capability registry — `describes` is called once
per tile inside a request that has already spent its round trips, and
`sentence_for` is a lookup.

## Why a stored narration needs checking at all

The figure is recomputed from the crawl on every page load. The sentence is
written once and kept. So the two can drift, and the drift is the worst failure
this product can have: prose written about 45 out of 65 rendered beside a fresh
39 out of 65. Both halves individually true, the sentence well written, nothing
on screen saying they describe different measurements — and a reader would act
on it.

`describes` is what stops that, and it errs towards dropping the sentence.

    **All five fields, and each one catches a case the others do not:**

    `numerator` — the figure moved. The obvious one, and the only one a
    single-field check would catch.

    `denominator` — 45/65 and 9/13 are both 69%. A changed denominator means
    the calculator changed scale, so prose about "most of the checks" was
    written against a different set of them.

    `percentage` — it is in `computed.values`, which makes it a numeral the
    prose is *permitted to state*. A rounding change would leave the numerator
    matching and a stated percentage wrong.

    `page` — the same score on two different pages is the same number about
    different things, and the sentence may name the page.

    `window` — the only place the fetch date lives. **A re-crawl the next day
    with an identical score must invalidate**, because the prose may cite the
    date, and citing a date we have since replaced is a false statement about
    when we looked. This is the case a naive implementation gets wrong: every
    numeric field still matches.

    Compared as strings throughout. `json.dumps` wrote `45`, `->>` reads back
    `"45"`, `str(45)` is `"45"`. Casting to `int` would raise on a malformed
    trace and turn a staleness check into a 500 on the dashboard — so a garbage
    value has to be a mismatch. A missing key gives `None` from `->>`, which
    never equals a `str()`, so an unreadable trace **fails closed**: we cannot
    prove the sentence still applies, and the honest response to that is to
    stop showing it.

# reason-to-sentence map in the TSX would be that failure with an extra step.

# by `calculators/audit.py` from a crawled page and no model touched it, so a
# refusal about the *explanation* must not read as doubt about the *figure*.
# "Something went wrong" beside 45 out of 65 makes a reader distrust the 45,
# which is the opposite of what this product is for.
