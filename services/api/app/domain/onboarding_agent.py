"""The onboarding agent: a plan over commands, not a prompt with tools.

The agent is deliberately *not* a model deciding what to do next. It is a small
state machine whose steps are commands, because the order of onboarding is a
product decision with a database schema behind it — which phase writes the Brain,
which one may promote a draft — and that is not a decision to re-derive on every
request from whatever the model feels like doing.

What the model decides is everything inside a step: what to ask, in what words,
in what order, and when there is nothing left worth asking. That is the split ADR
0019 was reaching for, held in code rather than in a system prompt.

    analysing -> brief -> discovery -> persona -> assembling -> ready

`discovery` is the loop. It runs `generate-questions` until the skill says it is
done or the safety limit trips, and each accepted turn is written with the field
it targeted and the scope that field carries.

**The four log keys an operator should care about, and which one to alert on.**
An earlier round asked for alerting on `onboarding.rejections_exhausted`; that
key now fires only when there is nothing left to ask at all, which is a clean
finish. Anyone who wired it got silence for the failure they meant to catch.

- `onboarding.fallback_served` (warning) — **the model failed repeatedly** and
  hand-written wording was used instead. This is the degraded case, and the one
  worth alerting on.
- `onboarding.floor_served` (warning) — the interview was about to end with
  nothing from the person's own department, so one was insisted on.
- `onboarding.ceiling` (info) — the interview ran its full length. Normal.
- `onboarding.rejections_exhausted` (warning) — every field with hand-written
  wording is already answered. Rare, and not a failure.

There is still no counter or metric behind any of these — they are log lines, so
rate has to come from the log backend rather than from the application.

"""A hard ceiling on the interview, independent of what the model wants.

Primarily a termination guarantee. Without it a skill that never returns `done`
walks a person through the entire catalogue — roughly twenty-three askable
fields — and the failure looks like the product being tedious rather than like a
bug.

It was 14, which was a ceiling nobody expected to reach and which the model
therefore reached: `question-generation` is asked "what should we ask next" and
there is always a defensible next field, so the ceiling became the *length*. A
person signing up met fifteen prose questions before seeing the product, which
is the point at which onboarding stops collecting better answers and starts
collecting shorter ones.

Five, plus the opening free-text turn, is the interview. Everything else is a
question the workspace can ask later, in context, when it has a reason to —
which is a better question anyway, because by then the person has seen what the
answer is for. Nothing is lost by not asking now: an unanswered field is a
`known_gap` with its own unlock, and that is what the gap list is for.
"""

"""How many refused questions before the hand-written fallback is served.

**Eight, until a browser showed what eight costs.** Each
`question-generation` call against the real provider takes 4.2 to 4.9 seconds,
so a fully-rejected turn spent **37 seconds** — past the thirty-second abort in
`apps/web/lib/auth-proxy.ts`, which means the founder saw a failure while the
API was still working and the fallback arrived for a client that had gone.

Four fits: four attempts is twenty seconds at the worst observed latency,
leaving ten for storing the answer and the round trips to `us-east-2`. Four is
also enough now that each attempt carries what the last one got wrong — the
retries were previously identical to each other, so eight of them bought
exactly as much as one.

`tests/test_onboarding_retry_feedback.py` asserts the arithmetic rather than
the number, so raising this fails the build with the reason attached."""
"""Consecutive rejected questions before the loop stops asking the model.

**It was 3, and three validators now share it.** The undeclared-target gate it
was sized for, plus the compound check and the shape check added later — all
three firing against `claude-haiku-4-5`. An audit of six interviews found half
of them ending here: Finance after one question, Chief of Staff after two,
Operations after **none**, each presented to the person as a considered
decision to stop.

Eight, because the arithmetic was wrong rather than the idea. A rejection is
one Haiku call of about a second and the failure reason is fed back, so
attempts are cheap and get better; an interview that asks a Head of Operations
nothing is not cheap at all. The question ceiling stays at `MAX_QUESTIONS` — a
rejected question is not a question asked, and conflating the two is what made
this a lost turn instead of a retry.

Exhausting these no longer ends the interview either. See `next_question`.

    # tokens over a prompt carrying up to twenty crawled pages. Two to four
    # minutes, and — because `scoped_connection` opens a single transaction for
    # the whole request — **nothing durable until all three had finished.**

    # A failure or a killed process at the third call therefore discarded the
    # first two, and the retry paid for them again. That happened: a 503 from
    # the proxy, clicked twice, six model calls, no rows written.
    #
    # Each command already writes its own stage and advances the phase —
    # `persona` then `assembling` then `ready`, which is why those two middle
    # phases exist in the enum. They were simply never committed separately.
    # Splitting the *caller* is the whole fix; the commands did not change.
    #
    # The route runs exactly one of these per request and commits it, choosing
    # which from the phase on the row rather than from anything the client
    # sends — the same rule as `submit_answer`'s target. A client that could
    # name the stage could skip one, and a Brain assembled without its persona
    # is not a shorter journey, it is a different artefact.
