"""Promoting a finished onboarding into the tables other agents read.

**Everything the interview collected used to stop here.** The agent path wrote
`onboarding_turn` and `onboarding_session` and nothing else: `INSERT INTO fact`
existed nowhere in the repository, `company_brain` was fed only by
`company_brain.build`, which reads `onboarding_answer` — a table whose sole
writer is the retired setup wizard — and `persona` only by the spine's own chat
route, which has no caller on this path either.

So two audits' worth of work on *which* questions get asked was landing in a
draft column that stage three of the assembly then overwrote with the
personalisation preamble. `_touch`'s docstring said promotion "only happens in
the two commands that do it explicitly". Those two commands did not exist. This
module is them.

Three rules it exists to keep:

**Nothing is promoted without provenance.** `ck_company_brain_grounded_has_provenance`
refuses a brain that cannot point at something, and every fact row carries a
`source_ref` precise enough to open. A value whose source was dropped along the
way is not written — it is logged and skipped, because a fact nobody can check
is the thing this product exists not to produce.

**A person's answer outranks everything.** Interview answers land at
`SourceKind.USER_CONFIRMED`, which `facts.PRECEDENCE` puts above a connected
system, a crawl, an inference and a document. That is not this module's opinion;
it reads the rank rather than writing a number.

**It runs inside the caller's transaction.** The last stage of `/finish` already
commits the session as completed; promoting in the same transaction means a
workspace is never left marked finished with nothing behind it, and never left
with a promoted Brain and an unfinished session.
