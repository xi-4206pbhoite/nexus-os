"""Reading and writing the agentic onboarding journey.

Thin on purpose. The routes decide what to do next and the agent decides what to
say; this module only knows how to put a turn in a table and get it back.

One rule it does enforce, because it is the only place that can: **a user turn
carrying a target must carry that target's scope**, and the scope is looked up
here from the field catalogue rather than accepted from the caller. The database
has the same rule as `ck_onboarding_turn_scoped_answer`; this is the layer that
makes sure the value is right rather than merely present.

    An enum rather than literals because the set is written in three places —
    this module, the agent's transitions, and the client's union type — and the
    migration's CHECK is the fourth. `test_constraint_enum_parity` compares this
    against the constraint on every run, which is the only reason the four
    cannot quietly disagree.

    **`DOCUMENTS` and `TOOLS` are between the interview and the assembly, not
    after it.** Everything the person supplies has to be in hand before
    `build_persona` and `build_company_brain` run, because those two commands
    are the moment the drafts become the artefact the rest of the product reads.
    A journey that assembled first and collected the files afterwards would
    produce a Brain that had never seen the price list it is quoting from, and
    the only repair would be assembling it a second time — paying for every
    model call again to reach a state that could have been reached once.

    So `finish` refuses to run from either of them: the ordering is a
    precondition checked in the database's phase column rather than a sequence
    the client is trusted to follow. Both steps are skippable (`doc/09` §6.2
    already makes the upload stage skippable), and skipping is an explicit move
    that advances the phase — not a silence the server has to interpret.
