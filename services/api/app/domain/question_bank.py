"""The department question bank, from `doc/08` §2-7.

Five questions per department, six departments. **Not the thirty-nine the
earlier drafts carried** — `doc/08` had already applied Q33's rule when it was
written, and this module applies it again on the way in: every question
declares, in `consumed_by`, the capability that reads it.

**A question with no consumer is not a question, it is a form field.** That is
Q33 in one line, and `tests/test_question_bank.py` enforces it — the guard
against this bank drifting back towards thirty-nine, which is what happens when
somebody adds "it would be useful to know" to a screen a founder has to get
through.

The `consumed_by` strings are the *capability* names, not table names or
function names. What matters is that a human can trace a question to the thing
that stops working without it, and argue about whether that thing is worth the
question.

**Scope.** Department questions are `L3_DEPARTMENT`, owned by the department
they are asked for, with two deliberate exceptions marked at their definitions.
Doc 06 §2.5's "tag them at capture" applies here exactly as it does to the
company stage: the scope travels with the question, not with the caller.
