"""The capability registry: one id space, the table, and the two derived numbers.

`doc/12` P15 (D8, Q64) and `doc/13` §5. Two jobs, and they belong together
because separating them was what let them drift.

## One id space

Until this module held the table there were **two capability id spaces and no
join between them**:

    dashboards.py offerings      doc 05 numbering       "3.2", "4.5", "5.8"
    question_bank consumed_by    doc 08 dotted names    "marketing.conversion_funnel"

Neither set of strings resolved in the other, and three things followed. Q33's
guard — *a question with no consumer is not a question, it is a form field* —
proved only that a question named **a string**, never that the string named
anything. `consumers_of()` returned `()` for every fact, so the review gate's
impact ranking (Q59) ranked everything equally. And no tile could say *"you told
me this"*, which is the whole of the day-one dashboard.

**The dotted name wins** (`doc/13` §25). ADR 0020 already chose it and tested it:
*"two departments will eventually both have a forecast, and a bare name makes
the collision invisible."* Two of them already do — `executive.risk_register`
and `strategy.risk_register` are both called "Risk register" in doc 05, and
`operations.capacity_utilisation` and `people.capacity_utilisation` are the same
offering surfaced on two pages. The doc 05 number is kept on every entry as
provenance, so a tile on a screen still traces to the paragraph that specified
it.

**Validated at import, not on first use.** The same rule `skills.py` follows: a
malformed table should fail the process and be caught by CI, never surface as a
customer opening a dashboard that cannot say what it needs.

**Not `domain/capabilities.py`.** That name was taken, by the P10 scope gate —
`Locked` and `locked_unless_in_scope`, which answer *may this caller compute
this at all*. Two modules about "capabilities" for two different questions is
how a reader ends up in the wrong one, so the table lives here, where the
counting already was.

## Two flags, because they are two facts

This module used to carry one `delivered`, `dashboards.py` carried a `DELIVERED`
frozenset, and `domain/marketing.py` carried a third set of its own — three
mechanisms for one question, which is how a shipped widget renders as "not built
yet", or worse, the reverse. They are unified here, and in unifying them the gap
they were hiding became visible:

- **`implemented`** — the calculation exists in code.
- **`reachable`** — a route serves it to a person.

Marketing's two audit capabilities were `implemented` and **not** `reachable`
for a year, and that pair is why the flags are separate rather than one
optimistic boolean: `calculators/audit.py` scored them and nothing could call
it, because the crawl kept only a page's text and threw the HTML away. A
completeness meter counting `implemented` would have told a founder they had
two capabilities they could not open.

Both are now reachable, through `grounding/compute.py` and migration 0028's
`page_signals`. `domain/marketing.py` — which held a third, disagreeing state
machine for exactly these two — was deleted with the wiring: `state_from_sources`
is the single answer, and it renders them `partial` rather than `live`, because
`seo_gaps` still owes keyword data and `brand_intelligence` still owes the voice
analysis its name promises. The flags stay separate, and `reachable` implies
`implemented` is still a test rather than a convention.

## The two numbers

**No literal 6, no literal 21 or 24, anywhere.** A denominator written as a
number is a claim nobody re-checks: it was true when somebody counted, and it
stays on the screen after a seventh department becomes scoreable or a company
selects four. Deriving it means the screen cannot disagree with the product —
and a founder who counts the tiles and gets a different answer has found a
reason to distrust every other number we show them.

# wrote it as a **distribution** one (dispatch, stock, suppliers). Neither is
