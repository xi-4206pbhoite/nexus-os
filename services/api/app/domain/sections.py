"""Sections, and the block each capability renders as.

`doc/13` §4 and §6. A director's page is **4-6 named sections**, not one list of
sixty tiles. The current UI is a flat `<ul>` of every offering, which cannot
express "Dispatch board" or "Receivables ageing" and does not survive the
catalogue: the section is the unit of navigation, the block is the unit of
rendering, and the capability is the unit of truth.

The section names are `doc/08`'s, verbatim — §2C to §8C. They are the cut that
was extracted from the prototype, so they describe screens somebody has already
drawn rather than screens somebody would like.

## Why a capability may have no section

`doc/08` is **narrower than `doc/05`**, and its §11 lists the gaps as
deliberate: the Growth Plan, the Content Studio, the content calendar, ad
creative and the Competitor War Room are *"not present. All are generation
features; none blocked by data."* Those capabilities are real, are in the
registry, and have nowhere on the current screens to sit.

So `section` may be empty, and empty means *in this director's catalogue, not in
this cut's sections*. It does not mean forgotten, and `test_sections.py` holds
the list so that moving one into a section is a deliberate edit.

**Two of those homeless capabilities are fed by a question**, which is a
different and worse thing — see `QUESTION_FED_WITHOUT_A_SECTION` below.

## The ninth block

`doc/13` §6 specified eight. Assigning all eighty found a ninth: eleven
capabilities are **generators** — the content studio, the proposal studio, the
policy library, job descriptions, SOPs, the board pack. A generator is not a
metric, a table or a panel; it takes an instruction and produces an artefact,
and forcing it into `panel` would have made a third of the product's value
render as an explanation of itself.
