"""The one path from a capability to a sentence a founder can check.

`doc/12` P14's acceptance test: *"Every number rendered anywhere traces to a
`generation` row naming its inputs and its calculation."* This module is what
makes "anywhere" true — it is the only way to get a narrated figure out of the
system, so a tile cannot acquire one by another route.

    assemble context -> compute (pure) -> guarded model call -> record the row

Each step already existed and none of them were joined. `pipeline.run` was a
pure function nothing called; `context.assemble` had no callers because there
was nothing to assemble for; and `generation` had two indexes, a check
constraint and no rows. This is the seam.

## Why the row is written even when there is no answer

Especially then. *"The tile said it could not compute this"* is a support
conversation, and without a row it is unfalsifiable: a missing input, a schema
failure and an exhausted budget look identical on screen and want three
different responses. The row is written inside the caller's transaction, so the
answer and its provenance are one fact — `audit.record`'s rule, for
`audit.record`'s reason.

## What this module refuses to do

**It does not compute.** `computed` arrives from `calculators/`, which is pure
and contains no model. Adding arithmetic here would make this a second place
numbers come from, and I1 is the claim that there is exactly one.

**It does not decide what a tile renders.** It returns an `Answer` and the id of
the row behind it. Turning that into `LIVE` or `UNAVAILABLE` is `state_for`'s
job, and a function that both produced the prose and chose the state could
disagree with the tile beside it.
