"""Which capability a calculator answers, and the figure it produces.

**The first code in this product to put a computed number on a path that ends
at a screen.** Everything until now either computed nothing or computed it in a
test.

It lives in `grounding/` because that is where I1's boundary is drawn — beside
`pipeline.Computed`, `context.assemble` and `answer.narrate`. Two other homes
were considered and rejected: `domain/marketing.py`, because one department's
module cannot own the product's dispatch, and `calculators/`, because that
package is pure arithmetic over a `PageSignals` and must never learn that
capability ids exist.

**Pure, and asserted pure.** It takes a snapshot, not a session, which mirrors
the shape `routes/dashboards.py::director_setup` already uses — read once,
then shape. A dispatch that took a session would have to be awaited per tile,
turning one round trip into one per capability.
