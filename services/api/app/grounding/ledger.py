"""The generation ledger: what was spent, and what every answer was made of.

`doc/12` P14. Two jobs, one table, and they are the same job seen from either
end. Reading `generation` backwards answers *"where did this number come from?"*
Reading it forwards answers *"what has this workspace spent today?"* — and
migration 0023 built an index for each direction while nothing wrote a single
row.

## Every outcome is recorded, including the refusals

An `unavailable` generation is the row somebody suspicious will actually read.
*"The tile said it could not compute this"* is a support conversation, and
without a row it is an unfalsifiable one — nobody can tell a missing input from
a schema failure from an exhausted budget, and all three look identical on the
screen. `ck_generation_reason_matches_outcome` makes the reason mandatory for
exactly this reason, so a row is refused rather than stored uninformative.

## The budget is counted, never estimated

`tenant_daily_token_budget` and `user_daily_token_budget` have sat in
`config.py` since M0 with nothing reading them. They are counted here from the
rows themselves rather than from a cache or a counter, because a counter is a
second source of truth about spending and the one thing worse than an
overspend is an overspend nobody can reconstruct.

**Both budgets bind, and the tighter one wins.** The tenant limit protects us
from a workspace; the user limit protects a workspace from one of its own
members. Neither implies the other — an owner can exhaust their own allowance
while the company has most of its day left.

**A day is a day in the report timezone**, not in UTC. A GCC founder whose
budget resets at 4am local time because the server counts in UTC has a budget
that resets in the middle of their working morning, which reads as an outage.

"""One query for both numbers.

Two queries would be two round trips to `us-east-2` on the hot path of every
generation, and — worse — two moments in time. A tenant total read a second
before a user total can disagree with it, and the disagreement always favours
spending.

## The second `AT TIME ZONE :tz` is load-bearing, and it was missing

`now() AT TIME ZONE :tz` converts to a **naive** local timestamp, and
`date_trunc` keeps it naive. Comparing a naive timestamp against a
`timestamptz` column makes Postgres reinterpret it in the **session**
timezone — GMT on this deployment — so local midnight in Muscat became
midnight *UTC*. Converting back with a second `AT TIME ZONE :tz` is what turns
naive local midnight into the instant it actually was.

**The window this opened was four hours wide, every day.** Between 20:00 and
24:00 UTC the cutoff sat in the future, so the query summed nothing, both
budgets read zero, and `exhausted` could not become true — the daily token
budget was simply unenforced for a sixth of each day, and the four hours moved
with the workspace's own reporting timezone.

Found at 22:13 UTC by a full-suite run, which is the only reason it was found
at all: three tests in `test_grounding_ledger_db.py` fail inside that window
and pass every other hour of the day. Same shape as the fixed-window rate-limit
boundary — a test that encodes "now" is a test that is green most of the time.
`test_the_day_boundary_is_the_workspaces_midnight_not_utc` pins it against an
explicit timestamp rather than against the clock.

    `audit.record` follows, for the same reason: a ledger row that survives a

    the answer is kept leaves a number on a screen with nothing behind it.

    The insert relies on the caller having set `nexus.workspace_id`, which
    `scoped_connection` does. `generation` carries `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
    with a `WITH CHECK` on `workspace_id`, so an unscoped insert is refused
    outright rather than landing in the wrong tenant.

    **`prose` is stored here and nowhere else.** Migration 0029 added it because
    the table held everything about an answer except the answer: a narrated
    sentence lived as long as its HTTP response, so a founder who reloaded a
    tile lost it. One row keeps the sentence, the inputs it came from and the
    arithmetic behind it as a single fact, which is what makes a disputed
    sentence traceable at all.

    in tokens, which are counted; money arrives when a price list does.
