"""One path from facts to an answer, and the rule that makes it trustworthy.

**Every number is computed, never generated** (I1). The model writes prose about
numbers it is *given*; if a figure appears in its output that no calculation
produced, the answer is **rejected**. Not corrected, not flagged — rejected,
because a plausible wrong number beside three right ones is worse than no answer
at all, and a reader has no way to tell which is which.

**The sequence is fixed**, and each step can only fail into the next:

    fetch -> compute -> one model call -> schema-validate -> retry once -> Unavailable

Never a cheaper unevaluated model, never a stale cache. Both are ways of
producing *something* when the honest answer is that we produced nothing, and
both look identical to success on a screen.
