"""A ceiling on request bodies, applied before anything parses one.

Finding B4. A 50 MB JSON body was accepted, buffered and parsed, and only then
refused by field validation — `phone` has a 32-character cap, so the rejection
was correct and arrived after the whole 50 MB was resident. Validation cannot be
the first line here: by the time Pydantic sees a value, the bytes are already in
memory, and a handful of concurrent large bodies is a memory-amplification lever
with no valid account behind it.

**Pure ASGI, not `@app.middleware("http")`.** That decorator is
`BaseHTTPMiddleware`, which materialises the request to hand it to a callable —
so a limit written there would have to read the body to measure it, which is the
thing being prevented. This wraps `receive` instead and counts chunks as they
arrive, so an oversized body is refused part-way through rather than after it
lands.

**Both the header and the stream are checked, and the stream is the real one.**
`Content-Length` is the cheap path: it refuses before a single byte of body is
read. It is also client-supplied and omissible — a chunked request carries no
length at all — so the header check is an optimisation and the running total is
the enforcement. Trusting the header alone is a limit that anybody can opt out
of by not declaring one.

**Two limits, because one would have to be the larger.** Document upload
legitimately carries 25 MiB, and every other endpoint on this API takes a small
JSON form. A single limit generous enough for the first is no limit at all for
the second, which is where the finding was.

**It is not a second implementation of the upload limit.** `MAX_FILE_BYTES` is
imported rather than restated, and the upload ceiling here is deliberately
*above* it: `app/documents/limits.py` is the authority on how large a file may
be, and it answers with a message about splitting the file. This only has to
stop a body nobody could have meant, so it adds slack for multipart framing and
leaves the real refusal where it belongs. Two implementations of one limit is
how a client says fine and the server says too big.

Generous on purpose. The largest legitimate body on this API is a form of prose
fields — `/onboarding/agent/describe` is three fields of 2,000 characters, and a
brief confirmation is a handful of corrections — so the real requirement is a few
tens of kilobytes. A quarter of a megabyte leaves room for an endpoint nobody
has written yet without leaving room for the finding: it is a ~200x reduction
from the 50 MB that was accepted, and still far below anything that costs
memory when a few arrive at once.

Chosen at the top of the range `doc`-level review suggested (64-256 KB) because
the failure mode of too tight is worse than of too loose here: too loose is a
bounded memory cost, and too tight is a legitimate request refused with a
message about size that its author cannot act on.

    25 MB document cap as "26112 KB" — a number nobody recognises as the limit
    they were told about. Changing it to megabytes fixed that and broke the
    other one, rendering the ~200 KB JSON ceiling as "0.2 MB", which is worse
    than what it replaced.

    So the unit follows the magnitude, as it would if a person were writing the
    sentence. One decimal on megabytes so a 25.5 MB cap does not round to the
    25 MB a founder just tried and had refused; none on kilobytes, where the
    fraction is noise.
