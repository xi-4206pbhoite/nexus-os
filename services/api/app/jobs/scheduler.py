"""Scheduled work.

Deliberately minimal. Doc 07 §3 calls for "a scheduler for crawls, refreshes,
score recomputation and briefs"; today there is exactly one job, and adding a
queue, a broker and a worker pool for it would be building for a load that does
not exist.

APScheduler in-process is the honest choice at this size, and it has one
limitation worth naming rather than discovering: **with more than one API
process, every process runs the job.** The expiry sweep is idempotent so that is
currently harmless, but the moment a job is *not* idempotent — sending a brief,
charging a card — this needs a real scheduler with leader election. That is
recorded here so it is a decision rather than an accident.

    Runs in the API process, like the expiry sweep. That is acceptable while the
    embedder is absent by default: `embed_pending` checks availability before it
    queries, and the model is imported lazily, so a deployment without the
    optional dependency pays nothing at all.

    It stops being acceptable the moment `[embeddings]` is installed in
    production - the weights are ~2GB resident, in the process that serves
    requests. At that point this belongs in a separate worker. Recorded here
    rather than in a backlog because the trade-off is invisible from the outside
