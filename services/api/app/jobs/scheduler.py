"""Scheduled work.

Deliberately minimal. Doc 07 §3 calls for "a scheduler for crawls, refreshes,
score recomputation and briefs"; today there is exactly one job, and adding a
queue, a broker and a worker pool for it would be building for a load that does
not exist.

APScheduler in-process is the honest choice at this size, and it has one
limitation worth naming rather than discovering: **with more than one API
process, every process runs the job.** The expiry sweep is idempotent so that is
currently harmless, but the moment a job is *not* idempotent — sending a brief,
charging a card — this needs a real scheduler with leader election. That is
recorded here so it is a decision rather than an accident.
