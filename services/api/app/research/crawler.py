"""Fetching pages from a user-supplied domain.

Every request goes through `validate_url` first, and **every redirect hop is
re-validated** — doc 06 §1.2. Redirects are followed manually rather than by the
HTTP client, because a client following them itself would connect to hops this
guard never saw.

Three caps, all required by doc 06 §1.2:

- **size** — read incrementally and abort past the limit, so a multi-gigabyte
  response cannot exhaust memory. Trusting `Content-Length` is not enough; it is
  supplied by the server being fetched.
- **time** — a total budget across the whole chain, not per request, so a slow
  server cannot hold a worker indefinitely.
- **hops** — a bounded redirect chain.
