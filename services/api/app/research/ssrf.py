"""SSRF guard for every server-side fetch of a user-influenced URL.

Doc 06 §1.2. This applies to the pre-registration crawl **and** to discovered
competitor URLs, which are shaped by search results and by the model and are
therefore not trusted input either.

The design decision that matters most: `validate_url` returns the **resolved IP**
and the caller connects to that address. Validating a hostname and then handing
the hostname to an HTTP client resolves DNS twice — once for the check, once for
the connection — and an attacker's nameserver is free to answer publicly the
first time and `169.254.169.254` the second. Pinning closes that window.

Everything here fails closed. An address we cannot classify is not public.
