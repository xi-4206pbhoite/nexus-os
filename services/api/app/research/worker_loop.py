"""The worker's loop: claim a run, dispatch its sources, record each outcome.

Everything it needs already exists — `CLAIM_SQL` takes a run without two workers
taking the same one, `crawl_site` returns an outcome instead of raising, and
`state_for` derives the run's state from its sources. This is the wiring, and
its whole job is to preserve Q56 across the join.

**Each source is written independently, as it finishes.** Not batched at the
end: a worker that crashes after five of six sources should leave five results
behind, and the founder watching the progress screen should see them arrive
rather than nothing for four minutes and then everything.
