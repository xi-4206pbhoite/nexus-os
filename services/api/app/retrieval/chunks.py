`ARCHITECTURE-LLD.md` §3.1, and I2/I3: **the permission predicate is part of the
query**, not a filter applied to its results. The difference is everything —
filtering afterwards means the database returned rows the caller may not see,
and every count, every `LIMIT`, every "no results" message computed before the
filter has already leaked their existence.

**No identity argument.** These functions cannot be asked to read "as" somebody:
the only way to say who is asking is to pass the `ScopedSession` the request was
authenticated into. A `user_id` parameter is exactly the shape that lets a bug
two layers up become a cross-tenant read, so it does not exist.
