"""This workspace's CRM deals, for the calculator to count.

I2/I3: takes a `ScopedSession`, never a `user_id`, and the RLS policy on
`crm_deal` is the floor the explicit `workspace_id = :w` doubles — the reason
`retrieval/crawl.py` gives, which is that it makes the index usable and compares
the same value the policy does.

## Rows, not a figure

This returns deals. `calculators/pipeline.py` counts them. The separation is I1's
plumbing and it is worth being exact about why: a total computed in SQL would be
a number produced outside `calculators/`, reproducible only by re-running a query
nobody kept, and the working drawer would have nothing to show.

`SUM()` in the SELECT would also make the currency problem invisible. Postgres
will happily add fils to cents; the calculator refuses, and it can only refuse
because it sees the rows.
