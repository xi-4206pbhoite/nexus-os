"""Company registration — the authenticated product's front door.

`doc/12` §Phase 5. Until now nothing here could create a workspace without a
verified domain, so a signed-up user had nowhere to go. D19 split that, and this
is the route that uses it: **register in one step, verify later.**

Two branches, and the second is the interesting one. If a *verified* workspace
already holds the domain, the honest answer is "that company is already here" —
offered as a **join request**, not a refusal and not a second workspace. Two
colleagues signing up separately is the ordinary case, and answering it with a
second company splits one business's data in half silently.
