"""Connecting a provider: start the authorisation, and take the callback.

`doc/14` step 9. Two routes, and they are asymmetric on purpose.

## Why `authorize` is a POST and `callback` is a GET

`authorize` mints a signed `state` bound to the caller and is therefore
CSRF-protected like every other state-changing route here. `callback` is a
**browser redirect from HubSpot** — a cross-site top-level GET, with no header
anybody can attach — so it cannot carry a CSRF token and `require_csrf` exempts
it by method anyway.

That is exactly why `state` has to do real work rather than be a random string.
`connectors/oauth.verify_state` refuses unless the session opening the callback
is the same person, in the same workspace, for the same provider that began the
flow. Without that, an attacker authorises **their own** HubSpot, captures the
code, and gets a victim to open the callback — after which the victim's
dashboard reports on somebody else's company, every figure individually
plausible.

## Who may connect

An Owner or an Executive. Connecting grants a read of the whole company's CRM,
which is not a department-scoped act, and `doc/05` §9 puts tool connection with
the people who answer for the company rather than with whoever happens to run
Sales.
