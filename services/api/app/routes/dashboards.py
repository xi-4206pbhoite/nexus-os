"""The seven director pages, and where a person lands.

Placeholders in the honest sense: the shell, the offering list and every
capability-to-source mapping are real and come from doc 05, and **no tile
carries a value**, because none has been computed yet. M8 and M9 fill them in
through `calculators/`, which is pure.

Two boundaries are enforced here rather than in the UI, and both are doc 06:

- **§2.3** — a caller reaching a department they do not hold gets a 404, via
  `enforce_department`. Not 403: *"this exists and you may not have it"* is an
  existence disclosure about how the company is organised.
- **§2.4** — the Chief of Staff page is Owner and Executive only, so a
  Department Manager's portal is six directors rather than seven. That cost is
  acknowledged in the document and is not softened here.

The list endpoint returns only the directors the caller may open. It does not
return the others marked "locked", and it carries no count of what was removed —
doc 06 §4.5, the same rule `filter_records` follows.
