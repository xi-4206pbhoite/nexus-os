"""Document upload — the first path that writes customer content.

Three obligations converge here, and each is enforced rather than assumed.

**Consent is a precondition, not a checkbox we log.** Doc 06 §5 requires the
customer to warrant their right to use what they upload, and migration 0007
backs it with `ck_document_consent_before_indexing`: a document cannot reach
`indexed` without `consent_given_at`. The practical control this represents is
someone indexing a competitor's leaked price list — the warranty makes that
their decision rather than ours.

**Failure is visible, always.** Doc 07 M5 requires a scanned PDF with no text
layer, an over-size file and a corrupt file to each say so. A silent failure is
worse than a loud one: the customer believes the document is searchable when it
is not, and finds out when an answer omits it — which reads as the product being
wrong rather than the upload having failed.

**Classification defaults to deny (I4).** Every chunk routes through
`classify_chunk`, which withholds to L5 plus the review queue on any parse
failure, classifier failure, or confidence below threshold.

What this module deliberately does *not* do is embed. That is task 5.6, and it
is a separate step because embedding is slow, needs a model, and must not sit
between the customer and their upload confirmation.
