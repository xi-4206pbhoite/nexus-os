"""The agentic onboarding journey, over HTTP.

Six endpoints, one per move a person can make. Deliberately not one endpoint with
a mode flag: each move has a different precondition, and a single handler
branching on a client-supplied phase would let a client skip one.

**Availability is checked once, at the front.** ADR 0022 makes onboarding require
a language model, so every endpoint here answers 503 with an honest detail when
no key is configured. It does not fall back to a form and it does not proceed
with defaults — the rest of the product still runs, which is the half of ADR 0011
that stands.

**The client never names a target.** `POST /answer` sends only text; the field the
answer belongs to is read from the agent's own last turn, server-side. A client
that could name the target could choose the sensitivity its answer is stored at.

    is the point: the caller is holding the row it just wrote to, and fetching

    Three model calls used to happen inside this one request — persona, brain,
    context, at high, high and medium effort — and `scoped_connection` opens a
    single transaction around the whole handler, so all three stages committed
    together or not at all. Two to four minutes of work with nothing durable
    until the end: a failure at the third call discarded the first two, and the
    retry paid for them again. The client's 240s abort and a killed process
    both land there, and both did.

    So this now advances the phase by exactly one step and returns. Three
    requests, three transactions, three commits. A stage that fails leaves
    every stage before it on the row, and the next call resumes at the one that
    failed rather than at the beginning.

    **The client does not choose the stage.** It is read from the phase on the
    row, under a `FOR UPDATE` lock taken before the read — the same rule as
    `/answer`, where the target comes from the agent's own last turn. A client
    that could name the stage could skip one, and a Brain assembled with no
    persona is not a shorter journey but a different artefact. The lock is what
    makes a double-click harmless: the second request waits, then reads the
    phase the first one advanced and moves on to the next stage instead of
    repeating the last.

    Idempotent at the end: called on a session that is already `ready`, it
    returns the state and spends nothing.
