"""Recording projects and tasks — the first place a customer writes into NEXUS.

`doc/15` S10.1. Every other route reads: a crawl we performed, a provider we
queried, answers given during onboarding. These accept records a founder types
and expects back, which brings three things this codebase has not needed.

## Who may write

**Anyone in the workspace, including a Contributor.** Deliberately wider than
`/connections`, and for a reason: connecting a tool grants a read of the whole
company's data, while recording a task is the work itself. A layer only managers
could write to would be a layer nobody uses, and `ops_layer`'s own
`cannot_answer` says this source fails on adoption rather than on an API.

A Viewer is still refused — `doc/06` §2.3 gives them company-wide material and no
department, and writing is not reading.

## Why there is no partial update

`PUT`, not `PATCH`. Two people editing one project is ordinary, and a field-wise
merge makes "whose value won" unanswerable after the fact. A whole-record write
with `updated_at` checked against what the client last read means the second
writer is told, rather than silently overwriting — see `_guard_conflict`.

## Archive, never delete

`DELETE` sets `archived_at`. A project that vanishes takes its tasks with it, and
a founder who archived something by accident has no way back. Every read filters
on it, so an archived row stops counting immediately without stopping existing.

    **The new default path.** `crm_deal` gained `archived_at` in `0041` so a
    typed deal follows the same "archive, never delete" rule as every other
    row type in this file, instead of the hard delete below standing behind
    nothing but a confirm dialog.

    `POST .../archive` rather than `DELETE /deals/{deal_id}` (`_archive`'s
    shape): that path already means the hard delete kept for compatibility
    below, and a second meaning on the same route would make the method the
    only thing telling them apart. `api-design`'s rule for a genuine non-CRUD
    action is a verb sub-resource, so this is that.

    Same guard as every other write in this file (`_may_write`), same CSRF
    dependency, same 204-with-no-body shape as `archive_project` and its
    siblings. Not routed through the shared `_archive` helper: that helper
    also sets `updated_at`, a column `crm_deal` does not have, and it writes
    only to the closed `ARCHIVABLE` set of `ops_*` tables — widening either
    for one table outside that family is a worse trade than the few lines
    here.

    Restricted to `provider = 'nexus'`, matching `delete_deal`'s own scoping:
    a synced deal is not this workspace's to archive, it is the CRM's to stop
    reporting.
