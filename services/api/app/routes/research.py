"""Research progress. **Never one spinner** (Q57).

A run fans out across six independent sources, and a single spinner over the top
of them is a lie of omission: it says "working" while the crawl has already
failed, the connector was skipped, and only keywords are still going. The
founder cannot tell whether to wait, to fix something, or to walk away.

So this returns **every source with its own outcome**, including the ones that
failed and why. A screen built on it can say "your website could not be read —
it renders with JavaScript; we will use your answers and documents instead"
while three other sources are still running.

The run's own state is derived from the sources (`state_for`) rather than read
from the row, so the two can never disagree on screen — which they would the
moment a worker updated one and crashed before the other.
