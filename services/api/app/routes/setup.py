"""Workspace setup: the onboarding answers, and the people invited to help.

Distinct from `routes/onboarding.py`, which is everything that happens *before*
a workspace exists — verify an email, prove a domain, create the workspace. From
here on there is a workspace, so every route in this module takes a
`ScopedSession` and every read goes through `scoped_connection`. The one
exception is invitation acceptance, and it is exactly the case that proves the
rule: the person accepting is not yet a member, so no scope can honestly be
built for them.

Two properties are worth reading the code for, because both are the kind that
quietly stop being true:

**Scope is taken from the catalogue, never from the request.** `AnswerIn` has a
`key` and a `value` and no third field. There is no scope to spoof, because the
classification is looked up in `scope_for_answer` — which raises on an unknown
key rather than defaulting (doc 06 §2.5, I4). A request cannot store its average
deal size as L1 by asking nicely.

**Answering is not authorising.** The `role` and `department` questions write
rows in `onboarding_answer`. Nothing here touches `membership`, which is the
only table `build_scope` reads. Doc 06 §2.2 calls a self-declared role privilege
escalation via dropdown; the reason it cannot happen is not that this module is
careful, but that the write it would need is not in this file at all.
