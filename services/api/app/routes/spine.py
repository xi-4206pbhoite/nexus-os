"""The onboarding spine, over HTTP.

`doc/12` §Phase 6. Three things the single-page wizard had no way to express:
where a founder is, what they have finished, and which departments they run.

**Progress is read and written server-side.** The client asks where it should be
rather than deciding — otherwise a stale tab, a Back button or a second device
each hold their own opinion, and the one that writes last wins. There is one
answer and the database holds it.
