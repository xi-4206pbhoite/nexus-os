"""`/evals/permissions` — the eight red-team specs (`doc/12` P10).

Executable specifications, not unit tests. Each one is an attack somebody would
actually try, written so that **breaking the predicate turns it red**. The
acceptance test for this phase is that removing `AND department && :depts` from
the query fails these; a spec that passes against a broken predicate is worse
than no spec, because it certifies the thing it was meant to catch.

They run against a real database, because the predicate *is* SQL. A mock would
be asserting that a string I wrote equals a string I wrote.
