"""Two steps between the interview and the assembly: documents, then tools.

Two changes, and they are one change.

**`ck_onboarding_session_phase` gains `documents` and `tools`.** They sit after
`discovery` and before `persona`, which is the ordering the whole feature is
about: the Persona and the Company Brain are assembled from whatever is in hand
when `finish` runs, so everything the person supplies has to be in hand before
it. A journey that assembled first and collected the files afterwards would
produce a Brain that had never read the price list it quotes from, and the only
repair would be assembling it again — every model call paid for twice to reach a
state that could have been reached once.

The order is not enforced here, because a `CHECK` on one column cannot see a
transition. It is enforced in `POST /onboarding/agent/finish`, which reads the
phase off this row under `FOR UPDATE` and refuses to start the assembly from
`discovery` or `documents`. What this migration guarantees is narrower and still
worth having: no other value can be written into the column, so the guard cannot
be defeated by a phase nobody planned for.

**`workspace_connection` records which systems a company runs on.** One row per
workspace per tool, with the *lifecycle* in a column rather than implied by the
row existing:

    declared -> connected -> (revoked | scope_reduced)

Every row today is `declared`, because no OAuth flow exists — `doc/12` P18 waits
on D3 for Google credentials and D10 for the CRM choice. That is exactly why the
state is a column. "The row exists" would have meant "we can read this system",
which would have been false for every row in the table, and the tile that
rendered from it would have come up empty rather than locked. `declared` says
the true thing: they told us, and we have never reached it. When the OAuth half
lands it moves the same row forward. No migration, no second table, and no
guessing afterwards about which connections were ever actually live.

`declared_by` is kept because a declaration is a claim somebody made. When a
Brain says invoices are in Xero and nobody can remember agreeing to that, the
question is who said so and when — and `updated_at` alone cannot answer it.
