"""`page_signals` — what each crawled page demonstrably contained.

**Why a table and not a JSONB key on something that already exists.**

Two candidates were rejected. `onboarding_session.research` is written by
`save_crawl`, which does `{k: _storable(str(v)) for k, v in dict(p).items()}`
(`app/domain/onboarding_sessions.py`) — a nested dict would be stored as its
Python `repr` and come back as an unparseable string. It is also written with
`research = COALESCE(research,'{}') || :patch`, a merge rather than a replace,
so a reader would have to know which of two differently-shaped writers wrote
last. `research_source.result_json` was rejected because it does not exist for
the onboarding path at all.

**Why this table exists now, having not existed for a year.**
`app/research/extract.py::extract_signals` and `app/calculators/audit.py` were
both written in M2, are both pure, and had **zero callers** — because the crawl
kept only `{"url", "text"}` and threw the HTML away. `PageSignals` was
unrecoverable from anything stored, so the scoring functions could never be
fed. This table is the missing half.

**`superseded_at` rather than a unique key**, matching `company_brain`. A
re-crawl marks the previous rows superseded and inserts fresh ones in the same
transaction, so a reader ordering by `position` cannot pick a stale page and a
history remains for anyone asking why a figure moved.

**`position` is the index into the caller's *kept* page list.** Onboarding
filters pages by `is_prose` after the crawl returns, so `position = 0` is the
first page that survived that filter, not the first fetched. `site.plan` orders
by priority, which makes 0 the page the crawl led with — a documented rule
rather than a guess about which URL is the home page.

**The `nexus_jobs` grant is load-bearing, and asymmetric to 0020 and 0024.**
The background crawl runs on the maintenance role (`app/jobs/scheduler.py` uses
`jobs_session()`), so without a grant `worker_loop._record` dies with
`permission denied` inside a broad `except` that renders to the founder as
"This step did not finish", naming nothing. Unlike 0021 this needs **no extra
policy**: policies are `TO PUBLIC` by default, so the workspace-isolation
policy below already covers `nexus_jobs`, and `_record` calls
`apply_workspace_scope` before writing. 0021 needed `USING (true)` because a
run is *claimed* before its workspace is known; a signals insert happens after.
