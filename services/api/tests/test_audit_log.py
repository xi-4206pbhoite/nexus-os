"""The audit trail is written, and reading it is a privilege.

Doc 07 I9. `audit_log` has existed since migration 0002 and nothing wrote to it
until P4 — which is the ordinary way an audit requirement dies. The table is
there, the schema review passes, and the log is empty.

So there are two claims here and they fail differently:

- **Every state change leaves a row.** Checked structurally *and* behaviourally.
  The structural half is an `ast` walk asserting each `AuditAction` has a call
  site, because a behavioural sweep over all nine would need nine fixtures and
  the one nobody wrote would be the one that silently stopped being logged.
- **Not everyone may read it.** A trail every member can read tells each of them
  who signed in, who was invited and who uploaded what — surveillance rather
  than accountability. Owner and Executive only.
