"""The morning brief's rules, asserted against the real calculator.

ADR 0029. Hermetic — `compose` is pure and the signals are built here, so the
whole file runs in milliseconds and needs no database. That matters beyond
speed: the brief renders at the top of every page load, so the thing most worth
proving is that it costs nothing and cannot refuse.

The failures these guard against all render as a perfectly plausible screen:

- a brief that ranks by something other than what a check cost
- one that turns an observation into advice
- one that says "nothing needs you" from eighteen checks on one web page
- one where an audit that never ran looks like an audit that found nothing
- one that reorders itself on every reload while saying the same thing
