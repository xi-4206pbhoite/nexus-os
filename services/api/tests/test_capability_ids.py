"""One id space, and the guards that keep it joined.

`doc/13` §5. The question bank has declared, since P7, the capability that
consumes each of its twenty-nine questions — and until this file existed nothing
checked that the declared consumer *was* a capability. Q33's guard proved a
question named **a string**. These prove the string names something.

The failure that makes this worth a file of its own: it looked like a working
feature. `consumers_of()` returned `()` for every fact, the review gate ranked
every fact equally, and no test failed — because a mapping between two
namespaces that share no members is empty rather than wrong.
