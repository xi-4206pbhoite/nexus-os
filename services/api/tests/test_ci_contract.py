"""The contract CI must satisfy before any other test in this suite means anything.

Ninety-two tests in this suite need a real PostgreSQL. Until this file existed,
a run with no database configured reported **92 skipped, exit code 0** — green,
and proving nothing. Row-level security is a database behaviour: the twelve
tests in `test_tenant_isolation.py` are worthless unless they *execute*.

Two halves, and both are needed:

- **here** — a database must be configured, reachable, and migrated to head, and
  the application role must be unprivileged;
- **`conftest.py`** — the one place a `requires_db` test may be skipped, paired
  with a `pytest_sessionfinish` guard that fails the session if it ever fires.

`test_a_skipped_database_test_fails_the_run` proves that guard rather than
asserting it exists, because a guard nobody has watched fail is a decoration.
