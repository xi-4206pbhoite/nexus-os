"""A company exists before its domain is proved — and can do less until it is.

**This reverses a rule.** Doc 07 M3's acceptance was *"no workspace exists
without a verified domain"*, and `create_workspace_for_claim` enforced it by
being the only path that could insert one. D19 splits that in two:

- **Creating a company needs no verified claim.** Verification is a DNS record
  or a file upload, and demanding it before a user can see anything at all put
  a systems administration task between a signed-up user and the product. Every
  `CurrentScope` endpoint answered 403 until it was done, which is why
  `AccountPanel` had a paragraph explaining the dead end.
- **Verification still gates what it always protected.** Inviting colleagues and
  connecting tools are the two acts that reach beyond the person doing them —
  one adds people to a company, the other pulls in its data. Those still require
  a proved domain.

So the property under test is no longer "no unverified workspace" but "an
unverified workspace **cannot do the things verification exists to protect**".
That is a weaker claim about existence and the same claim about authority, and
the tests below are written to fail if the second half slips.
