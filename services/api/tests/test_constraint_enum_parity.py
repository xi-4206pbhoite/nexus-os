"""Every value-list `CHECK` in the database, against the Python that feeds it.

This is the test for the *class* of defect Phase 1 exists to clear, rather than
for its two instances. `ReviewState` and `ck_chunk_review_state` were two
independent lists of strings that had drifted apart, and nothing could tell:
the enum type-checked, the constraint was valid SQL, and the only place they met
was an `INSERT` at runtime that no test had ever executed. `ck_document_status`
was worse — it had no Python counterpart at all, so `'superseded'` was written
as a bare literal in one place and permitted in none.

Two halves, and the second is what makes this durable:

- every registered constraint's allowed values must equal its enum's, and
- **every value-list constraint must be registered.** A new one added without a
  mapping fails the build, so the next constraint of this shape cannot arrive
  unwatched. Where no enum exists yet, the reason is written down in `UNMAPPED`
  and names the phase that owns it — and a stale entry there fails too, so a
  constraint that goes away takes its excuse with it.
