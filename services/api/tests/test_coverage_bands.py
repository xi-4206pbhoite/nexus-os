"""The three coverage bands, and the two ways they could quietly lie.

ADR 0030. The dashboard's opening figure is *"2 of 89 capabilities produce a
figure today"*, split into what measures, what reads a founder's own answers
back, and what is not built. Every one of those numbers was estimated in the
first draft of the design and **every one was wrong** — the denominator counted
a `RULE`, and a band called "unlockable by answering" held seven capabilities
when the true figure is zero. These are the assertions that stop that happening
in code rather than in a mock.

Two failures are worth naming, because neither shows on screen:

**A band that drops a capability.** Three counts that do not sum to the
denominator still render as three plausible numbers. `Coverage.__post_init__`
raises, and the tests below prove the guard fires rather than trusting it.

**An injected set that drifts from the real one.** `coverage` takes `measured`
rather than importing it, because `domain` importing `grounding` would run the
dependency backwards. That injection is only honest while the caller passes the
real set, so the agreement is asserted here — the same both-directions rule
`grounding/compute.py` already states for calculators and reachability.

Hermetic. The registry is a table built at import; nothing here needs a database.
