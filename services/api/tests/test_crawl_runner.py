"""The crawl source returns an outcome. It never raises past its own boundary.

Q56 again, and this is where it would be lost. A crawl that raises makes "one
source failing never fails the run" the *caller's* problem to remember — the
kind of rule that holds until somebody adds a second caller.

`fetch_page` is substituted throughout. What is under test is the orchestration:
which pages, when to stop, and what outcome each ending produces. The fetching
itself, with its SSRF guard re-applied per redirect hop, has its own tests and
is deliberately not re-exercised here — a second copy of that guard is the one
thing this module must never grow.
