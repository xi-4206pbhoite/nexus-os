    It said an absent CSRF cookie meant no session to protect, and that
    rejecting would turn every unauthenticated POST — including login — into a
    403 about the wrong thing. That is not true of the actual route set:
    `require_csrf` guards exactly five routes (logout, workspace switch, and the
    three domain endpoints) and **every one of them already requires a session**.
    Login and register do not use it at all.

    So the fail-open protected nothing and cost something. `nexus_session` and
    `nexus_csrf` are independent cookies with independent lifetimes, and either
    can go missing while the other survives — a page on a sibling subdomain can
    evict one by filling the cookie jar. This module exists precisely for the
    cases where `SameSite=Lax` fails, and cookie eviction is on that list, so
    returning early there disabled the layer in the exact scenario it was built
    for.

    A caller with no session still gets 401 from the session dependency. A
    caller with a session and no CSRF cookie now gets 403 instead of a free
    pass, and can recover by signing in again — which mints both cookies.
