"""Database timeouts, asserted on the server rather than on the keyword arguments.

`app/db.py` set none of these. A single query that never finished would hold a
connection from a pool of five until the process was restarted, and a
transaction left open by a request that died mid-flight would hold its locks
indefinitely — with `pool_pre_ping` cheerfully reporting the connection healthy.
On a serverless Postgres billed by connection-time that is also a cost bug.

The four that matter here are different from each other, which is why all four
are set rather than one:

- `statement_timeout` bounds a single query;
- `lock_timeout` bounds *waiting* for a lock, which a statement timeout does not,
  because a statement blocked on a lock has not started executing;
- `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` bounds an open transaction doing nothing
  — the shape a crashed request leaves behind, and the one that blocks DDL;
- asyncpg's `command_timeout` is client-side, so it still fires when the server
  is unreachable rather than merely slow. A server-side timeout cannot help
  when the answer never arrives.

Asserted with `SHOW`, against the application's own engine, because a test over
`create_async_engine`'s keyword arguments proves the arguments were passed and
not that Postgres accepted them — and `server_settings` names are silently
per-driver.

**That distinction stopped being theoretical.** The three server-side timeouts
originally travelled in asyncpg's `server_settings`, which becomes the startup
packet. Stock PostgreSQL honours it; **Neon's proxy filters the startup packet
and dropped all three**, so `SHOW statement_timeout` on a live application
connection returned `0` while `application_name`, sent in the same dictionary,
arrived intact. CI runs stock PostgreSQL, so these tests passed there throughout
— the protection existed in CI and nowhere that mattered, since ADR 0008 makes
Neon production (finding #15).

They are now issued with `set_config` on the pool's `connect` event. The tests
below are written so that reverting to `server_settings` fails them **on Neon**
and still passes on stock PostgreSQL, which is the honest shape of this problem:
no test run against one database can prove a claim about the other. Run the
suite against Neon before believing anything here.
