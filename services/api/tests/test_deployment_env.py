"""The deployed environment's required variables, in one place, generated.

`doc/12` P9: *secrets from the environment, not a file; document the required
set in one place generated from `Settings`.* A hand-written list of environment
variables is a list that drifts — silently, and the way you find out is a
deployment that boots and then fails on the first request that needs the
setting nobody wrote down.

So the document is generated from `Settings` and this test regenerates it and
compares. Adding a required secret without updating the deploy documentation
fails here, at the point the secret is added.
