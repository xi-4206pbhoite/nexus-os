"""What each department's one line says, and why four states rather than two.

`doc/14` step 6, and it answers the question that document left open: what a row
says for a department holding nothing.

`doc/13` §7's rule, applied a level up — **each state has to tell the reader
something different to do.** Two states that produce the same sentence should be
one state, and a state whose sentence is wrong is worse than no row. That is
what these assert: not that copy exists, but that the copy sent is the copy that
is true for the department it describes.

The failure that matters and would never look like a bug: telling somebody to
answer questions for a department where the questions are all answered and the
capabilities are waiting on an accounting system. They go looking for a form
that is not there, and conclude the product is broken rather than early.
