"""Upload, consent, visible failure, and the review gate.

Doc 07 M5's acceptance is *"a low-confidence document lands in L5 and the review
queue, and nothing is silently visible"*, and its validation step is *"upload a
payroll-like file; confirm it is not workspace-visible until reviewed."* These
are that, at the level the route actually decides things.

Hermetic: the storage write and the database write are substituted, because what
is under test is the route's decisions — consent required, failure surfaced,
classification withheld — not whether Postgres accepts an INSERT. The isolation
those writes rely on is proved separately, against a real database, in
`test_tenant_isolation.py`.
