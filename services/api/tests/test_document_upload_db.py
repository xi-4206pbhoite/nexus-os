"""The document upload path, against a real database.

`test_document_upload.py` proves the route's *decisions* — consent required,
failure surfaced, classification withheld — over a substituted `_record`. That
was a deliberate split, and it left a gap: twelve tests passed over a write path
that had never once touched Postgres. Both of Phase 1's certain runtime failures
lived in that gap. Every chunk INSERT violated `ck_chunk_review_state`, because
`ReviewState.NEEDS_REVIEW` is not one of the four values the column permits, and
the supersede UPDATE violated `ck_document_status`.

So this module writes for real. `_record` is **not** patched, the object store is
**not** patched, and the caller authenticates with a real session cookie against
a real `user_session` row, so `current_scope` resolves the way it does in
production and every write passes through row-level security.

What is seeded rather than driven: the tenant, user, workspace, membership and
session. Creating a workspace through the application needs a verified domain
claim, which needs a DNS or HTTP challenge to be answered — that is Phase 5's
UI and Phase 9's full-journey test (C3, C4). The subject here is the document
write path, and it is genuinely exercised end to end.
