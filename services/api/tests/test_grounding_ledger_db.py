"""P14's acceptance test: every number traces to a row naming its inputs.

`doc/12` P14: *"Every number rendered anywhere traces to a `generation` row
naming its inputs and its calculation."* The pipeline, the guard and eleven
evals existed before this file; what did not exist was **a single row in the
table**. `generation` had two indexes, three check constraints and nothing
written to it, and the budget those indexes were built for was never counted.

Against Neon, because the claims are about a table: row-level security on the
insert, a `date_trunc` in the caller's own timezone, and a constraint that
refuses an unavailable row with no reason. None of that can be proved against a
monkeypatched write, and the phase rule says so — *"driven through the
application rather than around it."*
