"""Rate limiting the credential endpoints, without becoming an oracle.

D14, answered in `doc/11` §5.2: **per-IP and per-email counters, exponential
backoff rather than a lock, and an identical 401 in every case with the delay
applied silently.**

Every clause of that is load-bearing, and the third is the one this file exists
to defend. The obvious implementation — a `429` with `Retry-After` once an
address has been guessed at too often — is worse than no limit at all for the
property M1 spent its effort on: a `429` keyed by email is a **confirmation that
the address has an account**, available to anyone, for the price of a handful of
requests. It would undo account-enumeration resistance in the act of adding
security.

So the contract asserted below is narrow and absolute: **a caller can tell they
are being slowed down, and cannot tell whose account they are slowing down
against.** The status, the body and the headers are identical for a real address
and an invented one, at every point in the backoff curve.

The lock was rejected for a different reason, recorded in `DECISIONS-REQUIRED.md`
D14: a per-account lock is a denial-of-service vector against a named user.
Anyone who knows an Owner's address could hold them out of their own workspace
during an incident, which is when they need it most.
