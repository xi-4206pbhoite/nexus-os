"""ADR 0026's four guards, and the one that replaces a deleted rule.

Multi-entity reverses Q9/Q17 — one person, one company. The reversal itself is a
deletion: `membership` was left many-to-many deliberately (`doc/11` §3.2, *"keep
the schema, constrain the product"*), so lifting the constraint needed no
migration. What needs care is everything around it.

The four:

1. **Reachable workspaces are exactly the caller's memberships.** This replaces
   `assert_no_live_membership`. A rule removed without its replacement asserted
   is a rule nobody notices the absence of.
2. **The group path never reads without a workspace scope.** Everything in this
   codebase is built so a cross-tenant read cannot happen, and the group view is
   the one read that spans tenants — so it opens one scoped session per entity
   rather than loosening a predicate.
3. **Nothing is cached across a switch.** I5 was retired with
   `_teardown_on_switch` and comes back with this. Entity A's figures under
   entity B's name is the worst failure this product can have, and it would look
   entirely normal on screen.
4. **Departments are per entity.** Somebody may be Finance at one and
   Operations at another, so a group read must not report one set.
