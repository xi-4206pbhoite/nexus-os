"""What a tile says when the sentence could not be written.

Seven refusal reasons, and **a real number is on screen beside every one of
them.** That is the constraint the copy has to satisfy and the reason it lives
in Python rather than in the TSX: the score was computed by
`calculators/audit.py` without a model, so a refusal about the *explanation*
must never read as doubt about the *figure*. "Something went wrong" beside 45
out of 65 makes a reader distrust the 45.

Total over **`NARRATION_REASONS`**, which is no longer the whole enum. `doc/20`
A2 added `NO_PASSAGE` and `UNCITED_CLAIM` for the assistant, and the assistant
has no computed figure on screen — so `test_no_sentence_puts_the_score_in_doubt`
below, which is the whole point of this file, cannot apply to them without
demanding copy that describes a score the reader is not looking at.

**That is a narrowing of scope, not of the guarantee.** A reason with no copy on
any surface still fails a test: `test_refusal_vocabulary.py` asserts that
`NARRATION_REASONS` and the assistant's set together cover every member, so a
ninth reason must be assigned to a surface before it can ship.
