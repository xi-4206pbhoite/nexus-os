"""The guided onboarding, end to end, against a real database.

Everything below the model is real: the routes, the agent, the commands, the
skill files on disk with their actual prompts and schemas, the SQL, the check
constraints and row-level security. Only the provider is a double, and it has to
be — a test that called Anthropic would be non-deterministic, slow, billed, and
would pass or fail for reasons that have nothing to do with this code.

`ScriptedProvider` raises on any skill a test did not script, so nothing here can
pass against output nobody wrote.

The three tests that matter are not the happy path:

- `test_a_generated_question_naming_an_undeclared_field_never_reaches_the_person`
  is ADR 0021's condition, exercised through HTTP and the database rather than
  asserted in a unit.
- `test_the_scope_stored_is_the_catalogue_s_not_the_model_s` is the same
  mechanism from the other side: the model says L1, the row says L3.
- `test_a_brain_value_with_no_provenance_is_dropped` is the NOT NULL column
  meeting the rule that produces it.

    close arms a timeout timer on the loop that made the connection; that loop
    is gone, so `loop.call_later` raises `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`,
    asyncpg falls back to `_abort()`, and aborting a **TLS** transport on
    CPython 3.12 leaves the socket open. `Pool._close_connection` swallows and
