"""The onboarding spine: resumable, department-driven, and honest about doubt.

`doc/12` §Phase 6. Three properties, and each replaces something the
single-page wizard could not do.

**Resumable** (Q28). Onboarding asks a founder for things they have to go and
find — a fiscal year start, a list of goals they have not written down. Any flow
that demands it in one sitting will be abandoned in the middle, and the abandoned
state has to be worth returning to.

**Department selection drives the product** (Q22, Q63). The seven directors are
not a menu of features; the selected set decides which dashboards exist at all.
Chief of Staff is automatic (Q24) because it consumes the others — a company
that selected none of them would have nothing for it to read.

**"Not sure yet" records an assumption, not a null.** This is the one that
matters most and is easiest to get wrong. A null says nobody was asked. An
assumption says somebody was asked, did not know, and the product proceeded on a
stated basis — which is a fact the Brain can later contradict with evidence, and
a null is not. It is also the difference between a blank dashboard tile and one
that says what it is assuming.
