"""Counting a workspace's own records — `doc/15` S10.1, ADR 0034.

`compute_from_ops` is the third dispatch in `grounding/compute.py` and the first
over rows NEXUS itself stores. These assert the arithmetic reaches the figure
unchanged, and — more importantly — that nothing in the shape can express a
rate. The ops layer fails on adoption, so a percentage over its rows is a wrong
number with a plausible denominator, which is the failure this product exists to
prevent.

Hermetic: the dispatch takes a snapshot, never a session.
