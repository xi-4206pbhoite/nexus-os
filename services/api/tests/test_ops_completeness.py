"""The gate every ops rate passes — `doc/15` S10.2, ADR 0035 (D29).

The ops layer fails on adoption, so a rate over its rows needs a fact the
database cannot hold about itself: somebody saying *"this is all of them"*. The
first ops rate is S10.4 and does not exist yet; these assert the rule anyway,
because a rule written after the code it governs is a rule written once somebody
has already shipped around it.

Hermetic: `calculators/` is pure by construction.
