"""Recording work, and the isolation a write surface needs.

`doc/15` S10.1's acceptance test. **This is the first place a customer writes into
NEXUS**, and a write surface fails differently from a read one: a read that
escapes its workspace shows somebody another company's data, while a write that
escapes *puts* data in another company — and the victim has no reason to doubt
it, because it appears in their own board alongside their own records.

`nexus_app` is `NOBYPASSRLS`, so an unscoped statement returns **zero rows rather
than an error** (CLAUDE.md). That is what makes these worth running against a
real Postgres: a hermetic version would assert a predicate string and prove
nothing about the policy.

Against Neon, with the sync-SQLAlchemy fixtures `test_surface_tiles.py` uses.
