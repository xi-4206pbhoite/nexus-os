"""All seven render states, each reachable and each with a distinct meaning.

`doc/12` P15. `WARMING` and `SELF_REPORTED` have existed in the enum since M5
and were unreachable in both layers — a state nothing can produce is a state
nobody has thought about, and it appears in code review as a handled case when
in fact it never happens.

The rule the whole ordering serves: **each state tells the founder something
different to do.** Two states that produce the same action should be one state,
and a state whose action is wrong is worse than no tile at all.
