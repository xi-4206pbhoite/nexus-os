"""The rail, the blocks, and the three gaps assigning them found.

`doc/13` §4 and §6. A director's page is 4-6 named sections; the section is the
unit of navigation, the block is the unit of rendering, and the capability is
the unit of truth. This file holds the joins between those three, and — more
usefully — the places where they do not meet.

Assigning all eighty capabilities to `doc/08`'s sections found three things that
are worth a decision rather than a fix:

1. **Two questions feed capabilities the cut cannot show anywhere.**
2. **Five sections `doc/08` draws have nothing behind them.**
3. **One block kind has no users yet**, because its section arrives in step D.

Each is asserted as an equality rather than a bound, so a *sixth* empty section
or a *third* homeless question fails here instead of shipping.
