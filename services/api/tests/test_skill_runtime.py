"""The skill runtime's invariants, and the one that replaces ADR 0019's ban.

The interesting test here is `test_a_question_targeting_an_undeclared_field_is_refused`.
ADR 0019 forbade generated questions because a generated question has no scope
tag. ADR 0025 lifts that ban on the condition that the tag comes from a declared
catalogue instead of from the model — so that condition needs a test, or the ADR
is a promise rather than a mechanism.
