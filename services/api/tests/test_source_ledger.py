#   carries it, so no capability lists it. **ADR 0023 makes it one of the first
#   two connectors to build**, which means the capability has to arrive with it
#   or the customer connects a tool that turns nothing on.
# - **`pagespeed`** — `calculators/audit.py` computes a performance score and
#   `doc/12` P18 promotes PageSpeed from the retired preview path, but there is
#   no `marketing.site_performance` capability for it to feed. The score exists

    An unbuilt capability cannot be unlocked by connecting something, and

    worse than no tile. The catalogue lives in `will_unlock`, which the tool's

    complete `marketing.seo_gaps`. **That is the first true call to action this
    product has ever had**, and asserting zero of them would now be asserting a
