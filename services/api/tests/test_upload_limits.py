"""The three upload limits, all enforced server-side (Q36).

`doc/11` stage 5: **25 MB per file, 20 files at onboarding, 500 MB per
workspace.** Three different limits protecting three different things, and the
reason they are all here rather than in the browser is that a limit the client
enforces is a suggestion — the endpoint is reachable without the client, and the
one caller who bypasses it is the one the limit exists for.

Each refusal has to say **which** limit was hit and what the number is. "Upload
failed" makes a founder retry the same file; "this file is over 25 MB, split it"
tells them what to do instead. That is the same rule the parse failures already
follow in `OUTCOME_MESSAGE`.

The per-file limit was **50 MB** until this phase — twice what the spec says —
because it was set from `doc/01` M1 before `doc/11` settled it. Nothing failed:
a limit that is too generous refuses nothing, so no test could have caught it.
